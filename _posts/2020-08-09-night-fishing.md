Roderick Petters turned the car onto the lake access road just as the sun was setting, its golden rays illuminating the trees on the other side of the deep blue water. However, the beauty of the scene was lost on Rod, who had other things on his mind and in his trunk.

As he approached the boat launching area, Rod saw two policemen in the process of pulling their patrol craft out of the water. _Oh shit_, he thought. _Not now. What the hell are the cops even doing in this small lake? There’s no way to turn around without arousing suspicion. I’ll have to talk to them._ He pulled his vehicle off to the side to allow them plenty of room to exit. He got out of the car and waved. One of the officers waved back. They finished loading their motorboat onto the trailer and drove it out of the water. Then they both started wiping the boat down.

Rod didn’t want to, but he figured he’d better make the first approach. He sauntered over to them and said, “Evening, officers.”

The older of the two men looked up and nodded. “Good evening, Sir. Planning to do a little night fishing?”

“Yes, indeed. Seems like it should be a perfect night for it.”

The officer looked up at the sky. “You got that right. After a hot day like this, those fish will be huddled at the bottom of the lake where the water’s cooler. They’ll rise to the surface as the temperature drops. What are you going after?”

“Oh, I’m not particular. Bass, I suppose. Or bluegill.”

The officer nodded. Rod noticed his nameplate. Thompson.

The younger man finished wiping down the boat and joined them. “Evening, Sir. Would you mind if we took a quick look at your fishing license?”

The older policeman smiled. “Officer Blackhawk is all business, I’m afraid. But if you wouldn’t mind…”

“Of course. I figured you might ask. Got it right here.” Rod gave him the document and Officer Thompson gave it a quick glance. He handed it back.

“Yep, everything’s in order. You got a working cellphone with you, Sir?”

Rod thought it a strange question, but he said he did have a phone.

“Would you mind checking it to see if you’ve got a signal up here?”

Rod pulled the phone out of his pocket and looked at it. “I’ve got two bars.”

“Should be good enough to make a call. Would you do me a favor, Sir? If you see anything out of the ordinary tonight, would you give us a ring? Here’s my card.” He handed it over. Rod glanced at it and put it in his pocket.

“Sure, Officer Thompson. But what do you expect me to see?”

The officer peered at him. “You new in town, Sir?”

“Yes, I drove up from the Twin Cities this morning.”

“So you ain’t heard of the recent troubles, then?”

“What troubles?”

“A few fishermen have gone missing in these parts. Three in the last two months.”

“We found their cars at the boat landing and their empty fishing boats in the water,” added Officer Blackhawk. “But so far there’s been no trace of the men.”

“At this lake?”

“One here. Two at Long Lake,” replied Officer Thompson.

_So that’s why they’re here_, thought Rod.

“Don’t suppose you’d consider doing your fishing in daylight?” asked Officer Thompson. “The disappearances only seem to happen at night.”

_Not bloody likely_, thought Rod. _But I’ll be sure to get out of here as soon as the job is done_.

“I guess I’ll take my chances, Officer. But I’ll be sure to call if I notice anything.”

“Alright, then. We can’t stop you. Just stay alert, Sir.”

“Will do.”

The policemen nodded and walked to their car. Rod waited until they had left the area before starting back to his vehicle. He swung the car around and carefully backed the trailer into the water. He unhitched the boat and tied it to the dock.

Rod scanned the sky. The light was fading, but not quickly enough for his taste. He didn’t want to finish loading until it was fully night. Then he’d need to do it quickly, just in case those cops came back.

He sat in his car and smoked a cigar, waiting for the darkness to fall.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two hours later, he decided it was time. There was enough moonlight to see, but hopefully not enough for anyone to be able to observe him from a distance. Not that other people were around, but in these situations you couldn’t be too careful.

He positioned the car as close to the dock as he could, then he got out and opened the trunk. He carried his fishing pole and tackle box out to the boat. Next came some rope and two cored cinder blocks. Rod walked back to the car and stood still for a moment, listening for any nearby car or watercraft noises. Finally, he reached into the trunk and lifted out a large black duffle bag. He grunted with the weight and dragged the 5-foot sack down the dock. He hopped into the boat and carefully pulled one end of the bag inside, then he lifted the other end and set it gently down. So far, so good. He scrambled onto the dock and rushed back to the car, closing the trunk and parking it quickly to the side. He rushed back to the boat, untied the ropes, and pulled the cord to start the engine. Nothing happened.

“God damn it, don’t quit on me now,” he muttered. He pulled the cord again and the motor roared into life. He sat down and guided the boat out to the middle of the lake.

_It was a perfect crime_, he thought. _I’m in the home stretch now._

Things hadn’t been right with his wife Dolores for a long time. Rod suspected that she blamed him for their failure to have children, which clearly wasn’t his fault. But their marriage was beset by plenty of other problems which _were_ at his door, not least of which were his drinking and womanizing. Still, she had taken him for better or worse, hadn’t she? When she told him she was considering filing for divorce, he was floored. How could she leave him? More to the point, how could her money leave him? Without her, he could kiss the mansion on Summit Avenue in St. Paul goodbye, along with her various properties in Hawaii, California, Switzerland, and Italy. He promised her the moon and swore he’d change his behavior, but he knew it was probably just a matter of time before his marriage and cushy lifestyle were history. He didn’t know what to do. And then he met Cynthia.

Cynthia Sanders worked at the Starbucks near his gym. She looked like a younger, prettier version of Dolores. The resemblance was uncanny, and the first time he saw her he was struck speechless. He turned on the charm, found her to be receptive, and started courting her. Given his wife’s current disposition, he was more than usually circumspect in keeping the affair a secret.

Rod told Cynthia he was married right from the start. He figured his plan would never work if Cynthia didn’t trust him implicitly. He went out of his way to please her, buying expensive gifts and taking her on lavish trips whenever he thought he could safely get away with it. He let several months pass before hinting at the possibility of removing Dolores from the picture. Had Cynthia not been willing to help him, he would have been in a real quandary. But as luck would have it, she went along.

The plan was simple. Rod convinced Dolores to join him for a few weeks’ vacation in Europe. They purchased their tickets. A week before their departure, he told her he’d need to delay his own flight for work reasons, but suggested she go on without him. She agreed, and they informed friends and relatives about her trip.

The flight left for London this morning, but Rod’s wife wasn’t on it. Last night, Rod struck Dolores on the back of the head with a lead pipe. He loaded her body in the car’s trunk and drove to Cynthia’s to spend the night. He gave Cynthia some cash, his wife’s passport, the keys to the European flats, and some old postcards Dolores had sent him from a solo trip she had taken several years ago. Rod had steamed the cards to remove the old postage stamps.

Cynthia flew to London using his wife’s passport and checked in at the Ritz as Dolores Petters. As she traveled around Europe, she’d mail back the corresponding postcards from each stop. She’d also make several calls to him at home, so that the phone records would corroborate her travel itinerary. After two weeks, she’d return to Minneapolis using Dolores’ passport, after which “Dolores Petters” would simply disappear. By the time Cynthia returned, Rod would have already flown to South America for an extended business trip, thereby ensuring he would not be a viable suspect in his wife’s subsequent disappearance.

After Cynthia had left for the airport, Rod hitched up his boat and drove to northern Minnesota. He threw the lead pipe into a lake on the way. Once the body was disposed of, he’d be free and clear. Cynthia was the only loose end. He had refused to give her any details of the murder or his plans to get rid of the body, so even if she turned on him later she wouldn’t be able to lead the police to any physical evidence. But she still represented a risk. Something would have to be done about that, and soon. He’d give it some thought during his South American trip.

Once Rod arrived at the center of the lake, he killed the engine and grabbed a length of rope. He passed it through the holes in one of the cinderblocks and the handles on the end of the black bag. He wrapped it carefully around the bag and block, looping it through several times. When the block was securely attached to the bag, he tied off the rope. He sat up and scanned the lake. He thought he saw a small light in the distance and his heart stopped for a moment. But the light didn’t reappear, and he decided it was just his imagination.

He lifted the unweighted end of the black bag over the starboard hull. That side of the boat tipped toward the water. He fed a length of rope through the handles of the bag and looped it three times around. Then he passed the rope through the holes in the second cinder block and lifted it carefully over the hull to rest on top of the duffle bag. He secured the block to the bag and wound the cord around several more times before finally tying it down.

With one end of the bag and its attached weight now hanging over the side of the boat, Rod moved to the center and bent down to pick up the other end. He stood up and carefully balanced the bag on the edge of the boat for a moment, then in one swift movement, he lifted his end and pushed it over the side. There was a loud splash and the boat rocked significantly before settling down.

Rod looked over the side at the dark water and said, “Goodbye, Dolores. And good riddance.”

He saw the light again. And then he heard the sound of an outboard motor being started.

“Shit,” he muttered. He stepped to the stern and pulled the engine cord. Nothing. He pulled again. Nothing.

He picked out the outline of a fishing boat in the moonlight and watched as it came closer.

Rod began to panic and he tugged at the starter cord again. It snapped back and cut into his hand. But the motor remained quiet.

“Hello!” shouted a voice.

_Calm down_, Rod thought to himself. _The evidence is over the side. There’s nothing to worry about._

“Ahoy!” Rod said as the motorboat drew alongside. It contained two men who had apparently been granted more than their share of testosterone. They were smiling, which only made them appear more threatening. The first man was dirty and unshaven in tattered clothes. He had short sleeves which exposed two extremely muscular arms covered in tattoos. More tattoos adorned his neck. The other man looked like a heavyweight wrestler. He had a sizable scar running down the left side of his face. There was a shotgun propped up next to his seat.

“We heard a big splash and wanted to make sure you were alright over here,” the tattooed man said.

“Oh, I was just throwing a fish back, that’s all.”

“Izzat so? Seemed like an awfully big splash for a fish,” tattoo man said.

“And I can’t help notice that your fishing rod is still in its case,” said the wrestler. “Were you fishing with your hands?”

“Um, I just put it away,” said Rod. “I’m done for the day.”

“Didn’t catch much, did you?” tattoo man sneered, as he looked into the boat.

“You wouldn’t be dumping stuff in our fine lake, now, would you?” said the wrestler.

“Because we really wouldn’t take kindly to that,” added tattoo man.

“Not kindly at all,” said the wrestler.

“I wasn’t dumping,” Rod said.

“Uh-huh. You got a fishing license?” asked tattoo man.

“Of course.”

“May we see it, please? We’re legally appointed conservation officers for this area.”

_My ass, you are_, thought Rod. _But I just want to get out of here._ He handed over his license.

Tattoo man peered at it. “This license is expired. It must be destroyed.” He ripped up the paper and threw the pieces in the lake.

“Hey!” Rod shouted.

“There’s a $200 penalty for fishing without a license. Payable now. Cash only,” said the wrestler.

“But that’s nothing compared to the penalty for dumping,” added tattoo man.

“Yeah, the cops don’t like that kind of thing. They might even send some divers down to see what you dumped,” said the wrestler.

“You guys are nothing but scam artists,” said Rod.

The wrestler’s hand seemed to move a little closer to the shotgun.

Rod thought better of his objection. “I’m sorry. I don’t want any trouble,” he said. Rod slowly reached for his wallet, not making any sudden movements. He opened it up and pulled out $200.

“We’ll take another $100 to forget about the scam artist crack,” said tattoo man.

Rod resisted the urge to respond and handed over $300.

The wrestler grabbed the shotgun and pointed it at Rod.

“Maybe you’d best give us all of it, asshole.”

Rod thought back to the three missing fishermen and wondered if they’d be finding another empty boat on this lake tomorrow. He handed over his wallet. Tattoo man removed the cash and threw the wallet into the water.

“Hey, what about the credit cards?” said the wrestler.

“Them things is an invitation to get caught,” replied tattoo man. “They’re better off in the lake.”

“What about him?” asked the wrestler.

“He ain’t gonna say nothin’. I’m guessin’ he don’t want whatever he just dumped to be dredged up. Ain’t that right, Roderick Petters? Who lives at 1215 Summit Avenue in Saint Paul?”

“That’s right,” said Rod, sweating profusely now.

“Have a pleasant evening,” said tattoo man.

The wrestler grimaced and spit into the lake. He started their engine and they went back in the direction they came from.

Rod exhaled, feeling he had come very close to death. He waited for the sound of their engine to recede. Then he moved to the stern and pulled the cord again.

Nothing. _Shit. I need to get out of here._

There was a sudden noise, right behind him. Rod’s heart skipped a beat. He turned to see a fish flopping back and forth in the bow.

_I’ll be dammed. The thing must have jumped right into the boat!_

Rod approached the fish. It was incredibly ugly. He had never seen one like it before. Then again, he wasn’t really a fisherman, so what did he know?

_Strange, it seems to have some kind of fishing line in its mouth._ The line trailed over the side of the boat into the water.

_It must have been in the process of being hauled in by someone when the line broke. Anyway, whatever. It’s your lucky day, Nemo. Not that anyone would want to eat a fish as ugly as you._

Rod reached down to pick up the creature and toss it back into the water. As soon as he lifted it, several sharp quills suddenly popped out of the fish and pierced his hands. Rod was too startled to even scream.

The fishing line tightened and pulled him toward the starboard hull. Now came the scream, but it didn’t last long. Rod lost his footing and was dragged over the side.

As he was pulled deeper into the inky darkness of the lake, he thought he glimpsed a light ahead. Then he saw the source of the light. He inhaled a lungful of water.

The luminous thing at the bottom of the lake was not even remotely human. Nor was it a fish.

Whatever it was, though, it had a fishing pole and knew how to use it.

The next morning, police found an abandoned car and motorboat at Little Long Lake.
