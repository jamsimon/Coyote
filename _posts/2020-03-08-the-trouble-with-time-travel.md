“The trouble with time travel is that it’s so danged complicated,” explained Professor Puffinhead. “But I think I’ve got all the kinks out of it now.” He scratched his balding head and stifled a yawn. “Excuse me. I’ve been working without much sleep for the past week or so. Very excited to test my machine, you know.”

Connor Underman looked dubiously at the complex machinery which filled the lab in Berkeley, California. He looked even more suspiciously at the eight-foot-tall clear glass tube that he was supposed to step into. But a hundred bucks was a hundred bucks. And seriously, what was the chance that the thing would actually work? The guy was obviously a crackpot.

The professor turned a few knobs and pushed several buttons on the control board. “There. That should do it. Now, listen carefully, Mr. Underman. I’m going to send you just one hour into the future. I will be there to greet you. I want you to hold this control switch. If anything goes wrong, anything at all, just push the red button and you will be brought back to the current time.”

Connor took the control and asked, “What do you think will go wrong?”

“Oh, nothing, nothing. It’s for emergencies, that’s all. Please step onto the platform.” The professor pushed a button and the glass cylinder slid upward.

Connor stepped onto the circular base, and the tube lowered around him. “What kind of emergencies?” he asked.

“Hmm. Um, nothing that I can think of, Mr. Underman. It’s simply a precaution. Are you ready?” Not waiting for an answer, the professor pushed a few buttons.

“I’m not sure I…”

There was a flash of light and Connor was suddenly floating in outer space. The earth hung out in front of him, the size of a dinner plate. He tried to scream but the air flowed out of his lungs without making a sound. He couldn’t breathe! And it was cold. Incredibly cold. I’m going to die, he realized. And then he remembered the control switch in his hand. He pushed the red button…

…and was back in the glass tube. He gasped for air and dropped to the ground.

The professor raised the cylinder and ran toward him. “Mr. Underman! What happened? I pushed the button and you just collapsed. Did my machine not work?”

Connor caught his breath and stammered, “I was in space. I saw the earth. I almost died.”

Professor Puffinhead clapped his hand against his forehead. “Ah. I knew I had forgotten something. I’ll have to modify the algorithm.”

“What?”

“Don’t you see, Mr. Underman? You traveled in time, but not in space.”

“If I didn’t travel in space, why was I suddenly floating above the planet?”

“Ah, _You_ didn’t move, but _Earth_ did. During that one hour, the earth continued to revolve around the sun. At thirty kilometers per second, it would have traveled, oh, about 68,000 miles or so in space. Thus, when you reappeared the earth was long gone, you see.”

“You could have killed me!”

“Not intentionally,” the professor stammered. “And it’s for Science. Oh, and for money, I suppose. Here’s your hundred dollars. I do hope you will come back for another try, once I make the necessary adjustments.”

Connor took the money. “Not on your life, Doc.”

“But think about what you could do when this machine finally works, Mr. Underman. You would have first-hand knowledge of the future! Wouldn’t that be fantastic?”

Connor walked toward the door. And he thought about horse racing, football games, and stock markets. He turned back. “All right, Doc. I’m your guy. For science. Call me when you’ve got the kinks worked out. But not until then, okay?”

“Excellent! Thank you, Mr. Underman.” The professor walked off, talking to himself. “Now, let me think. I’ll also need to adjust for the solar system’s movement through the galaxy. And for the galaxy’s rotation. And the galaxies are all moving apart from one another, as well. Ah, time travel is so complicated…”

.........................................................................................................................................................................

Two weeks later, Connor returned to the laboratory to find the professor on his back underneath one of the electrical cabinets, making adjustments with a screwdriver.

“There. That should do it. That’s the last one.” He closed the panel door and stood up.

Connor smiled nervously. “Are you absolutely sure you got the bugs worked out?”

“Oh, yes. I’ve adjusted for the orbital velocities of every celestial object I could think of. Very tricky, I must say, because every Newtonian frame of reference is equally valid, you see. So which one is the one that matters? I had to create a universal frame of reference that compensated for any type of motion and then translate the results back to an Earth-based focal point.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about, Professor. But did you fix it?”

“Yes, yes. I made modifications for everything I could think of. I think I can say with a high degree of confidence that you will reappear on Earth this time. Here’s your control switch. I put it on a little strap that you can attach to your wrist. Isn’t that nice? Well, are you ready?”

Connor checked his pocket. Yes, he had a pen and paper to note down the winners of the fifth race at Golden Gate Fields. If he returns quickly, he can place several bets online before the cutoff. He nodded to the professor. “I’m all set. Let’s do this.”

Connor stepped onto the platform. The tube came down.

“OK, here we go,” said the professor. “5…4…3…2…1…”

And Connor was suddenly flying very fast over some water. He looked around. There was no land in sight. He quickly pushed the button…

…and was back in the lab.

“You’re back!” shouted the professor. “What happened this time?”

“I don’t know. I was suddenly flying through the air above the waves. There was no land around. Nothing but water. I would have died out there if it weren’t for the control switch.”

The professor thought for a moment. “Nothing but water? Ah. The earth’s rotation. Yes, I see.”

“You told me you got all the bugs out!”

“Well, yes, I took care of celestial motion. But I neglected to adjust for the earth’s rotation around its own axis. Silly of me. The earth rotates at about one-thousand miles per hour. So in the hour that transpired, you would have reappeared about a thousand miles west of here. Yes, that would plop you into the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Sorry about that. But it’s an easy fix, compared to the last one. Give me a day to work it out.”

Connor walked out with another hundred bucks, wondering if this was worth risking his life for.

.................................................................................................................................................................................

The next day, Connor was back, presumably having answered the last question in the affirmative.

“Are you _really_ sure you’ve got it right this time?” he asked the professor.

“Yes, Mr. Underman. As far as I can determine, you will reappear inside the glass tube.”

“Do you absolutely guarantee it?”

“Ahem. Nothing can be unconditionally guaranteed, Mr. Underman. But I’m as sure as I can be. I would take the trip myself if I didn’t need to operate the controls.”

Connor wondered if the professor would have made the same claim the last two times he tried this. Whatever. He grabbed the control switch and strapped it to his wrist. He stepped onto the platform. The cylinder came down. 3…2…1…

…and suddenly Connor’s body was flung sideways into the glass, which shattered on impact. There was an excruciating pain in his left arm. He blinked and the glass tube was still intact. Connor screamed and grabbed his wrist. The cylinder rose and the professor rushed to his side.

“Am I in the future?” Connor asked.

“No. When I turned the machine on you just started screaming.”

“The glass cracked. My wrist is broken, I think.”

The professor examined Connor’s arm and confirmed that his wrist was broken. Then he looked at the glass cylinder. “The glass didn’t crack … unless it did so in the future. Ah. I think I understand. Angular momentum. You’re a lucky man, Mr. Underman. You might have easily died in that attempt.”

“Unlike the previous two, you mean? What happened to me this time?”

“Well, it’s rather interesting, really. You see, we are all moving in a circular motion around the earth as it rotates. The only thing that prevents us from flying off into space is the earth’s gravity. When you reappeared in the tube, the earth had been rotating for an hour. You were moving in a different direction when you left here, and you kept moving in that direction when you reached the future. I estimate that you would have hit the glass at something like 600 miles per hour. You should be dead. The only thing I can figure is that the control switch was the first thing to hit the glass. It depressed the button and sent you back here before the rest of your body made impact.”

“So why didn’t this happen before?”

“It did, I believe. But there wasn’t anything for you to crash into before. The first time, you were in space and without any nearby objects for comparison, you wouldn’t even realize that you were moving. The second time, you said you were flying over the water, right? And you punched the button right away. You never lost much momentum so you got back here okay. But I should have realized that angular momentum was a problem when you said you were moving. I was too focused on the earth’s rotational effect on your position. Sorry about that. It won’t happen next time.”

“There won’t be any next time. I’m done with this.”

“I see. That is your decision, of course. Here is my card. Please call me if you change your mind. In any case, let me take you to the hospital and pay for the treatment of your arm. It’s the least I can do.”

Connor slipped the card into his jacket pocket and they left the room. About fifty-five minutes later, the glass tube suddenly shattered into a million pieces, which flew across the lab.

..................................................................................................................................................................................

The following week, Connor received a phone call from the professor, asking if he’d be willing to give time travel one last try.

“Why me?” asked Connor.

“You already know how this works, for one thing. Plus, I don’t want people to hear of my experiments until I publish my results. Academia is a frightfully competitive business, Mr. Underman. Until my paper is printed in a scholarly journal, the fewer people who hear of it, the better.”

“Well, I don’t know…”

“I’ll pay you a thousand dollars for one more trial.”

“When do you want me to be there?”

One hour later, Connor arrives at the lab with his left arm still in a cast. Professor Puffinhead greets him at the door.

“I guess you figured out how to deal with the momentum problem, then?”

“Well, no, not exactly.”

“What?? I’m not going in that thing just to get squashed again, Professor.”

“You won’t be squashed. Listen. I tried to find a way to change the direction of your angular momentum so you arrive in the future standing still. It can’t be done. Momentum is a conserved property, so changing its direction is only possible through the application of a sudden force. And the degree of force that this would require would kill you. But I figured out an easy workaround.”

“What’s that?”

“Instead of sending you one hour into the future, I will send you forward twenty-four hours. That way, the earth will have made a full revolution and you’ll arrive moving in the same direction as when you started.”

“Okay, that makes sense. I guess.”

“Very well. Here is a new control switch. I’m going to hang it around your neck this time. Are you ready for one more time trip?”

“A thousand bucks, right?”

“In cash. I have it right here.”

“Then let’s do this.”

Connor stepped upon the platform, and a new glass cylinder smoothly lowered into place around him.

“Very well, Mr. Underman. Here we go… 3… 2… 1…”

Connor blinked, and the professor disappeared. The lab was empty. What the hell, Connor thought. The professor was supposed to be here to meet me. He glanced at the clock on the wall. 4 pm. The damn thing didn’t work. No, wait. He said the machine would send me forward 24 hours. So the time wouldn’t have changed. But is today still Tuesday, or is it Wednesday?

Connor took out his smartphone and checked the date. June 24. Wednesday. So it did work. I’m in Tomorrowland. I’ll be dammed.

He knew what he needed to do next, but it required him to be on the other side of the damn glass tube. He shouted, but no one came. He reached out with his good hand and tried to push the glass upward. It gave a little. He crouched down and managed to lift it just enough to get his hand underneath. With some effort, he pulled it up and slipped underneath.

Connor walked out of the lab and headed for the newsstand. Halfway down Durant Avenue, he had to cross over to the other side of the road. Part of the sidewalk had been roped off with yellow tape which read “Police line – Do not cross.” He glanced at the blood-stained wall. The bay area isn’t as safe as it used to be, he mused. He continued on.

At the newsstand, he bought a copy of the evening paper and immediately flipped to the back pages. There it was. Closing stock prices. Racing and sports results. Connor smiled. Now to get back and place some bets.

As he walked back along Durant, Connor noticed the professor running toward him from across the street, shouting something.

“Mr. Underman, stop!”

Aw, hell, Connor thought. The old fart has figured out what I’m doing. Well, he can’t prevent me now.

Connor reached for the control switch.

“Whatever you do, don’t push the…”

................................................................................................................................................................................

At precisely 4 pm the previous day, Professor Puffinhead saw Connor disappear. Unlike the other trial runs, however, he did not immediately reappear.

The professor waited. 4:30 pm. 5:00 pm. 6:00 pm. Nothing.

What could possibly have gone wrong this time?

There was a knock at the door. The professor opened it to find two police officers on the steps.

“Professor Peter Puffinhead?”

“Yes, that’s me.”

“Officers Randolph and Kowalski. We’d like to ask you a few questions, Sir, if that’s okay.”

“Of course. Would you like to come in, Officers?”

They stepped in and came straight to the point.

“Do you know Connor Underman?”

“Yes, he’s been working with me on a science experiment. Why?”

“I’m afraid he’s dead, Sir. We found him on Durant Avenue. He had your card in his pocket.”

“Dead? I don’t understand. I saw him only a couple of hours ago. How did he die?”

The officer wiped his brow. “Well, to be honest, Sir, that’s a bit of a mystery. It seems he was thrown forcibly against a wall. Most of his bones were broken. The coroner’s people are at a loss for how it could have happened.”

“Oh my God. It was me. I killed him.”

This was clearly not the response that the officers expected. “Excuse me, Sir? Did you say that you killed him?”

“Well, sort of. Physics killed him, to be more precise. Angular momentum. I should have seen it coming, though.”

“Uh-huh. Well, I think the detective in charge will want to speak with you at length about this matter. Could you please come with us, Sir?”

.................................................................................................................................................................................

Professor Puffinhead was held overnight for questioning. It turns out that the police take an apparent confession of murder very seriously. The detective grilled him for hours on end. For some reason, he did not appear to believe the professor’s time travel explanation.

On Wednesday afternoon, the police decided that they had to release him, given the lack of evidence. The Professor was let go with a stern warning not to leave the bay area.

Professor Puffinhead stood up and put on his jacket. “What time is it?” he asked.

The detective looked at his watch. “4:10 pm.”

The Professor shouted, “Why didn’t I think? Maybe I can stop it!” He rushed out of the room just as a representative from the coroner’s office arrived.

“What was all that about?” she asked.

“Just some crazy guy. He says he sent the victim forward in time, and the poor sod was killed by physics when he returned. Something about angular momentum and the fact that he stayed in the future too long. He’s obviously looney toons.”

“Time travel? My God. I know that seems daft, but look at this.” She tossed a newspaper on the detective’s desk. He picked it up and glanced at the headline.

“It’s today’s paper. So what? What am I supposed to be looking at?”

“It’s just that the victim had this on him when he died. When he died, _yesterday_. Before that issue was published.”

...................................................................................................................................................................................

Professor Puffinhead left the Police Station and started running toward the lab. He was grossly out of shape, however, and he had to slow down after a block and a half. Then he realized that he was heading in the wrong direction. Underman had probably left the lab by now. Although the professor didn’t know where the man went, he was certain where Underman would eventually end up. He jogged as fast as he could toward Durant Avenue, hoping he didn’t have a coronary on the way.

A few minutes later, the professor reached the location of Underman’s untimely demise, and he saw the man himself converging toward the spot.

“Mr. Underman, stop!” the professor yelled.

Horrified, he watched as Connor reached for the control switch.

“Whatever you do, don’t push the…”

Connor disappeared.

“…button.”

The professor stopped, sat down on the curb, and cried.

Time travel’s a bitch, he thought.
