I wrote the following prologue, but so far I have no idea what the book is about.

Prologue

In the beginning, there was nothing but God. Time did not exist at this point, but if it had, it would have been extremely bored for an exceptionally long interval. 

Finally, God got fed up with nothingness and said, "Let There Be Light."  And because He was in a generous mood, He simultaneously created Space and Time at no additional charge. 

And there was a Big Bang, even though no one was around to hear it except God.  Which really settles the whole "tree falling in an uninhabited forest" thing, because if the Big Bang hadn't happened the Universe wouldn't exist. So clearly, it did. 

And the Light was Good.

And because Light cannot exist without its opposite, there was Darkness. The Darkness wasn't exactly what you'd call Evil, but you wouldn't want to buy a used car from it.

And God created the Heavens and the Earth. Truth be told, this took longer than a day, but no one was counting. And He created the Angels. And some were light and some were dark and many were shades of gray.

And He produced many forms of Life on Earth. He tweaked and tinkered with each of His creations, until one day He concocted Man. And now that He was really getting the hang of this thing, He created Woman, which was even better. 

And then He said, "Let's play a game and see whether Man becomes light or dark."

So He created the Devil. And the Devil said, "Would You like to make a little side wager on this?" And God did.

And while God was looking elsewhere, the Devil whispered into Man's ear, "free will."

And then all Hell broke loose.
