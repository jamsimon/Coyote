Judith Krantz approached the ramshackle old house cautiously, noting the five-foot-tall weeds in the garden. Some of the windows were boarded, and others contained broken panes of glass. A few two-by-fours were propping up the west side of the structure. _There’s no way that anyone lives here_, she thought. But the home’s address was on her list, and she felt she had a duty to at least knock upon the door.

She stepped upon the first wooden stair and it creaked with her weight. She moved to the side, hoping that her foot wouldn’t go straight through the rotted board, and brushed against a cobweb. _This is nuts. I should just turn around and get out of here._ _Aw, what the hell, I’m almost there. Might as well just get it over with._

Judith approached the door, from which pieces of green paint were flaking off. I’ll probably get lead poisoning if I touch that thing, she thought. She removed her red scarf and wrapped it around her hand, then knocked upon the door, which creaked open with her touch.

“Hello,” she called. “United States Census. Is anybody home?”

_Of course not._ She turned to go.

“Come in,” a gravelly voice said. “I don’t move that well.”

_Oh, crap._

“I don’t really want to come in, Ma’am.” She hoped it was a ma’am, anyway. It was hard to tell. “Can I just ask you a few questions from here? Question 1. How many people were living or staying in this house on April 1, 2020?”

There was a long pause. Then the voice said, “I can’t hear you. Come inside.”

“I SAID, QUESTION 1. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE LIVING OR STAYING IN THIS HOUSE ON APRIL 1, 2020?” she yelled.

A longer pause. “What’s that, dear? Come in, I won’t bite.”

_Crap._ “Okay, I’m coming in.” Judith stepped inside, leaving the door open in case she had to bolt. It was dark. She felt along the wall and found a light switch. Relieved, she flipped it on but nothing happened.

“Just walk straight back. I’m in the living room.”

_It’s a man. I should get out of here_. She thought about trying to shout her questions again, and then she realized that it was too dark to read her crib sheet or take notes. There was a dim light ahead. She kept moving.

Something darted in front of her, scaring her half to death.

_Just a cat_, she thought. _At least I hope it was a cat. I’m being silly. He’s just an old man. Let’s get this over with._

She entered the room.

The last thing she saw with her peripheral vision was a figure moving quickly from the right. There was an incredibly sharp pain in her back. She dropped to the floor. A liquid touched her hand. She realized that it was her own blood, then she lost consciousness.

“That makes twelve,” said the voice. “One more.”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three days later, twelve-year-old Bobby Grisham and his younger brother Tom were practicing baseball in the field adjacent to the old house. Tom was at bat, facing the building. He took a swing and missed.

“You throw like a girl!” shouted Tom.

“That’s sexist,” chided Bobby.

“No it’s not!” said Tom, retrieving the ball. “What does sexist mean?”

“It means you’re saying something you shouldn’t. Anyway, some girls can throw like a guy.”

“That’s sexist,” said Tom.

“No it’s not,” said Bobby. “I don’t think it is. Anyway, you can pitch for a while if you think it’s so easy.”

They switched places.

Tom underhanded a perfect toss and Bobby connected with it, sending the ball in a high arc toward the house. A moment later there was a loud crash as the ball shattered a second-story window and went into the bedroom.

Both boys stood for a moment, dumbstruck.

“That ain’t good,” said Tom.

“Oh shit,” said Bobby.

“That’s sexist,” warned Tom. “Anyway, you better get that ball. Mom will be mad if she finds out you lost it.”

“I’m not going into that house,” said Bobby.

“You have to. You hit the ball, Bobby. It’s your fault. And if you don’t get it back, I’ll tell.”

Bobby looked at his brother. _Yeah, he’ll tell_. _I guess I’ll have to get the ball,_ Bobby thought.

_Bullshit. That’s not what I’m thinking at all._

Bobby walked toward the house.

_No, I’m not walking toward that house. Who do you think you are, putting thoughts into my head and action into my feet?_

BOBBY WALKED TOWARD THE GODDAMN HOUSE.

_HEY, I CAN USE CAPITAL LETTERS TOO, YOU JERK. I JUST TOLD YOU I’M NOT GOING INTO THAT HOUSE, AND THAT’S FINAL._

Seeing Bobby hesitate, his brother Tom decided to get the ball himself. He started walking toward the house.

“Stay where you are, Tom! Don’t listen to that asshole.” _That’s a low blow, trying to manipulate a seven-year-old kid._

Look, Bobby, I’m the narrator and you have to do whatever I say. It’s as simple as that. Now walk toward the damn house.

_To hell with that, Narrator. There’s a serial killer in there. I’m not going to die._

You’re not supposed to know that there’s a serial killer in there.

_Yeah, well, I can read, can’t I? He already killed a girl on page two. Plus, just look at the place. Even if I hadn’t read the earlier text, who in his right mind WOULDN’T think there was a serial killer in there?_

A man appeared at the broken window of the house. “Hey, what’s the holdup out there?” he yelled.

This damn kid won’t go in!

“What do you mean, he won’t go in? You’re the narrator. Just write him doing it.”

I did, but it didn’t work! The kid’s just standing there, thinking to me that he won’t go in!

“What kind of narrator are you? Let’s get a move on. I’ve got an audition for a Stephen King short story this afternoon.”

Another figure appeared next to the man in the window. “What’s going on?” she asked.

“You’re dead, Judith. Go back and lie down,” the killer said.

“I got tired of waiting for the story to move on. Then I thought, maybe I don’t have to be dead after all.”

“That ax in your back says differently,” smirked the serial killer. “Hey narrator, you tell her.”

Judith Krantz was totally dead. She died three days ago, in fact. Her body lay in a large puddle of dried blood on the living room floor. She definitely was not standing in the window carrying on a conversation with her murderer.

_Oh, stuff it, Narrator_, she thought, as she stood at the window.

“And, hey,” added the serial killer. “Would it be too much trouble to give me a name? It’s very impersonal to keep calling me ‘serial killer’ or ‘murderer.’ How about Derek?”

The serial killer, whose name was Derek, backed away from the window and stopped chatting with his previous victim and the narrator, as it was interrupting the flow of the story.

“Hey, asshole, it’s not me interrupting the flow. You get that kid in here so I can murder him. But thanks for the name.”

“I knew it!” yelled Bobby. “He was going to kill me. There’s no way I’m going in there now. I’m heading home. C’mon, Tom.”

Tom looked up at the window. “Hey, you up there! Can you please throw our ball back down?”

“Sure, hon,” said Judith. She threw the ball out the window. Tom waved and retrieved it. Then he and Bobby started off for home.

Hey, I didn’t narrate that. What do you think you’re doing, Judith?

“I guess you’re not the only one who can narrate, Dick.”

My name’s not Dick.

The narrator, whose name matched his personality, was called Dick.

Stop that! Narration is _my_ function.

“And you’re doing a crap job of it,” said Derek.

Dick sat typing at his computer, confused at the bizarre turn the story had taken. While he concentrated on finding a way out of the mess he had created, he didn’t notice the lurking hulk in the shadows, who rushed at him with an office implement and stapled him to death.

OW! STOP IT, JUDITH! OW!

Dick slumped to the floor, dead.

I’m not dead, Judith. How do you kill someone with a staple gun anyway? Cut it out.

Fine. But let’s agree that I’m not dead either, ok?

Fine. 

Miraculously, the ax wound in Judith’s back was not fatal after all. But it severed a nerve which caused her to lose the ability to narrate. 

How's that, Judith? Are we good?

“We’re good,” said the newly recovered Judith. “Should I continue with the census questions then?"

Sure. Why not? I have no idea where this story is going anymore, so have at it.

Judith turned to Derek and said, "Question 1. How many people were living or staying in this house on April 1, 2020?”

“Um, just me, I guess,” said Derek. “I’m not positive, because it was a bit before my time if you know what I mean.”

“Very good. I'll put down 'one.' Question 2. Where there any additional people staying here on April 1, 2020, that you did not include in Question 1?”

So Question 2 simply asks whether you lied in your answer to Question 1? Seriously?

“Hey, Dick, I didn’t write these questions. They’re directly from the official census. Look it up. Some brainiac in Washington D.C. actually got paid to formulate that question.”

What’s Question 3, then? Let me guess. How about, “Are you sure your answer to Question 2 is right?”

“No, Question 3 asks whether you own or rent the place, or are just a freeloader.”

I see.

Derek has been very thoughtful this whole time. Suddenly he asks, “Hey, wait a minute. If she’s alive now, does that mean I’m back at number eleven?”

Yes.

“That sucks. I haven’t made any progress at all, then. What’s Stephen King going to think?”

Who cares what he thinks? He’s probably going to pick someone or something else over you, anyway. Maybe an evil dog. Or a car. Or a hotel. Or a banana. I don’t think he’s written about a monster banana yet. But I could be wrong.

“No, seriously, I need to show some initiative. What am I going to say when he asks me how many victims I killed in my last story? Eleven doesn’t sound like very many. I need an even dozen, at least.”

“Derek, I don’t think you can take credit for any deaths,” said Judith. “Those first eleven happened before this story even began.”

“Damn. You’re right. I’m sunk. I’ll be laughed out of King’s office.”

“Maybe you can kill the narrator,” suggested Judith.

You tried killing me already, Judith, don’t you remember? It didn't work. Besides, I thought we had a deal. Maybe you can kill the author instead.

“Aren’t you the author?” asked Derek.

No. I suppose I could be, but not in this story since I’m acting like a character. The author is different.

“Okay,” said Derek. “Let me try that. Now, how do I narrate?”

Just write something as if it just happened, and don’t use quote marks.

“Okay, here goes,” said Derek.

The author sat typing at his computer, confused at the bizarre turn the story had taken. While he concentrated on finding a way out of the mess he had created, he didn’t notice the lurking hulk in the shadows, who rushed at him with an office implement and stapled him to death.

HEY! YOU CAN’T DO THAT!

The End

I SAID, YOU CAN’T …

The End.
