I wrote the following prologue, but so far I have no idea what the book is about.

Prologue

In the beginning, there was nothing but God. Time did not exist, but if it had it would have been a really long, boring interval. 

And finally, God got fed up with nothingness and said, "Let There Be Light."  And there was a Big Bang, although no one was around to hear it except God. And it was Good.

And because Light cannot exist without its opposite, there was Darkness. And it was Evil.

And God created the Heavens and the Earth, although truth be told this took longer than a day. And He created the Angels. And some were light and some were dark and many were shades of gray.

And He created Man. 

And then He said, "Let's play a game and see whether Man becomes light or dark."

So He created the Devil. And the Devil said, "Would You like to make a little wager on this?" And God did.

And while God was looking elsewhere, the Devil whispered into Man's ear, "free will."

And then all Hell broke loose.
