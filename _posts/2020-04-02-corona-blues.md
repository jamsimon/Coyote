Sittin’ in front of my TV

Watchin’ the mornin’ news.

I’m sittin’ in front of my TV

Watchin’ the morning’ news.

They’s talkin’ all kinds of bullshit

An’ I got the corona blues.

I used to have some money.

I used to paint the town.

Yeah I used to have some money.

I used to paint the town.

Now all the bars are closed an’

Both my stocks and me are down.

Some blame it all on China.

(They shouldn’t eat no dog.)

Some blame it all on China.

(They shouldn’t eat no dog.)

Me I don’t care how it started,

I jus’ sit and write my blog.

If I had some toilet paper,

I’d wipe myself all day.

If I had some toilet paper,

I’d wipe myself all day.

But Costco got no paper.

Guess I’ll buy me a bidet.

Talkin’ with my son now,

A board game we do play.

I’m talkin’ with my son now,

A board game we do play.

But it’s hard to reach the dice when

You sit six feet away.

President on my TV.

Top o’ the evenin’ news.

President on my TV.

He’s top o’ the evenin’ news.

He’s talkin’ all kinds of bullshit

An’ I got the corona blues.
