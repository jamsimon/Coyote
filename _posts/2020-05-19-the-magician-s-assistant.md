I first met The Great Zucchini in 1965, following one of his late-night shows in Harlem. After being sawn in half and put back together, his previous assistant had run screaming from the theater. I got a good view of her face as she sprinted down the aisle. If it was an act, she deserved a Tony award hands down. But the girl didn’t look like a career thespian to me, so I figured there might be a job opening. I was right, as it turned out.

As soon as the theater emptied, I snuck backstage and knocked on the dressing room door.

“Enter and be amazed,” called a voice.

I entered but found nothing too amazing taking place. The Great Zucchini was sitting at the dressing table, wiping stage makeup off his face. A golden-haired toy poodle sat in the corner of the room, yapping at me.

“Cool it, Copperfield. Take a break,” the magician said. The dog stopped yammering and lay down, staring at me. Zucchini looked up. “Yeah? You looking for an autograph? It’ll cost you five bucks. And I don’t do kids’ parties, so don’t even ask. Last time, one of the little monsters broke my wand and his baby brother puked all over my shoes. Never again.”

“Actually, Mr. Zucchini, I was wondering if you might be looking for a new assistant. I’d like to apply for the job.”

Zucchini stroked his white goatee and considered this for a moment. Then he said, “Debbie may come back.”

I shrugged. “You know her a lot better than me, Mr. Zucchini. But I’ve never seen a woman run that fast in high heels. She looked like she was being chased by a swarm of angry bees. Unless I’m grossly mistaken, that high pitched scream was her letter of resignation.”

“Yeah. Maybe you’re right. Do you have any experience as a magician’s assistant? Ever been on stage? Do you perform any magic yourself?”

_Aw, crap_, I thought. I briefly considered lying but decided he’d find out the truth soon enough. I played the honesty card. “No,” I said. “I’ve never acted before and I don’t know the first thing about magic.”

Zucchini smiled. “Well, that’s a relief. I never hire anybody with experience. Those people think they know how things should be, and they’re always wrong. What’s your name, dear?”

“Susan. Susan Parsnip.”

The magician looked at his poodle. “Copperfield, say hello to Miss Parsnip.”

The dog responded with a single “yap,” then walked off to investigate his food dish.

“He’ll know you now. If you play your cards right he may even allow you to pet him someday.”

“I’ll try to live up to his expectations,” I said.

“Yes. Now then, Miss Parsnip, what kind of work experience _do_ you have?”

“I, um, worked as a bank teller for a couple years until the bank went belly-up. Before that, I was a waitress at a diner.”

“Very well, my dear. My next show starts at seven on Wednesday night. If Debbie doesn’t return by then, you’ve got the job. Be at the backstage door by six and wear black stockings and high-heeled shoes. I’ll supply the costume. We generally do six shows a week. You get seventy-five bucks per show, in cash. If you decide not to declare it to the IRS, that’s your business. Sound okay to you?”

“Yeah, thanks. But won’t I need to practice first? How can I walk on stage without any preparation?”

“You let me worry about that, my dear. Everything will be fine if you remain calm and simply follow my instructions.”

“Okay, Mr. Zucchini,” I said.

But to myself, I thought, _If it’s that easy, why did Debbie run out screaming?_

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I showed up backstage at a quarter to six on Wednesday. Copperfield was apparently unimpressed with my entrance, and didn’t bother to get up. Zucchini handed me a costume and said he hadn’t heard from Debbie. She didn’t even stop by to get her money for the last show.

I changed my clothes behind a partition and stepped out. Zucchini gave me a once-over and said, “Yeah, that’ll do.”

“Yap,” added Copperfield.

“I still don’t understand what I have to do, Mr. Zucchini.”

“Don’t worry about it, my dear. Mainly you’re there to look nice and to take some of the audience’s focus off me. There are only three things you need to know.” He paused for dramatic effect.

“And they are?” I asked.

“Number one, magic is real.”

“Sure it is, Mr. Zucchini. I’m with you. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil the illusion. But don’t I need to know where the secret compartments are, and all that?”

“No, no, you misunderstand me. I am not asking you to _pretend_ that magic is real. I am asking you to _believe_ it. I do not deal in illusions. There are no secret compartments in my show. No wires, keys, mirrors, or hidden panels. _My … magic … is … real._ I know that 99 percent of professional magicians use some form of trickery to fool the audience. They are nothing but charlatans. Please do not ever suggest that I am one of them. Do you understand me?”

“Magic is real. Check,” I said. _What a fanatic_, I thought to myself at the time. That was before I knew better.

“Number two, follow my instructions to the letter. When I tell you to remain still, REMAIN STILL. I can’t emphasize this point enough. You need to trust me. This is very important. You may be acutely uncomfortable at times, particularly when we get to the sawing-in-half part. But I shall not let any harm come to you. And that brings us to number three.”

“Which is?”

“Don’t panic. As you so aptly put it, if you run screaming from the stage I will take that as your letter of resignation. Are we clear on everything?”

I nodded. “Magic is real. Follow instructions. Don’t panic.”

“Yes. I believe that covers it.”

There was a knock on the door. A voice outside shouted, “Five minutes.”

“That’s our cue,” said Zucchini with a wink. “We’re on. Copperfield, stay.”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The seats in the theater were only half-filled, but Zucchini didn’t appear to mind. He started with a card trick. “Go and select someone from the audience,” he told me. “It doesn’t matter who.”

I picked an attractive woman from the sixth row. She followed me onto the stage and Zucchini fanned the cards in front of her. “Pick a card, any card, and show it to the people in the first row. Don’t let me see it,” he told her.

The lady did so. I saw she had chosen the seven of hearts.

“Good,” said Zucchini. “Now take the rest of the deck and put your card inside. Shuffle it well, then lay the cards upon the table, face up. I shall look at the cards without touching them and tell you which card you picked.”

When the cards were laid out, Zucchini approached them with his hands behind his back. He looked at the tableau.

“But madam,” the magician said, “are you trying to trick me? Your card is not here.”

The woman insisted that she had placed it in the deck.

“Look for yourself, then.” Zucchini backed away. I’d swear on a stack of Bibles that he never touched the cards. The lady from the audience bent over the table, and I watched her paw through the deck. The seven of hearts was not there.

“You’re right,” the woman said. “It’s missing. I don’t understand. Where is it?”

“Let’s find out. Will the person who catches this tennis ball please come forward?”

Zucchini placed his right arm over his eyes. With his left hand, he tossed the ball into the back of the auditorium. A man caught it and walked toward the stage.

When he had reached the bottom of the steps, Zucchini said, “That’s far enough. I don’t wish to have contact with you. Please take out your wallet. In view of the first row, examine its contents and remove anything which doesn’t belong.”

“There’s a playing card in here which I’ve never seen before. The seven of hearts.”

The applause of the audience almost drowned out the woman’s confirmation that this was indeed the card she had chosen. Both volunteers retook their seats.

I figured both of these people had been plants, but I didn’t know how Zucchini had arranged to get them selected. I’d chosen the lady at random. And Zucchini’s aim with a tennis ball couldn’t have been that accurate, could it?

Anyway, The Great Zucchini had the audience’s attention from that point forward. He performed one magic trick after another. Even standing right next to him, I could never figure out how he’d done any of them.

Then he told me to get the disappearing box from the side of the stage. I wheeled it out. It was a wooden container standing upright, about seven feet tall with a door on one side. Zucchini had me turn it around so the audience could see it was solid on all sides. Then he asked for a volunteer to stand behind the box during the trick, to confirm that there was no way for me to sneak out the back.

He opened the door and he whispered to me as I stepped in. “Be still, and don’t panic. It’s better to keep your eyes closed. Breathe normally. I will have you back in a jiffy.”

I stood facing the audience and closed my eyes. He shut the door and a moment later there was a strange little “pop” sound. It was dark. Darker than it had any right to be. I reached out to touch the side of the box, just to steady myself.

My hand didn’t touch anything. I opened my eyes and saw that it wasn’t totally dark. There were tiny little pinpoints of light all around me.

They were stars.

I started to panic. I breathed faster. Then I realized that I shouldn’t be breathing at all. Since I was, I couldn’t be floating in outer space. I forced myself to be calm and closed my eyes. Just when it seemed like it had been way too long, there was another “pop.” I felt a rush of air and a beam of light.

I opened my eyes and was standing in the box facing the audience. People were clapping. The Great Zucchini appraised me with a curious expression and offered his hand. I grasped it and stepped out of the box.

“Take a bow,” he whispered. I did. Then I recalled that Debbie had been wearing a strange expression at this point in last week’s show. It was probably the same look that now adorned my own face.

Suddenly, I was not looking forward to being sawn in half. I considered sprinting toward the exit doors. But as if he knew my innermost thoughts, Zucchini took hold of my hand and whispered, “Don’t worry. It won’t hurt, and you won’t be harmed in any way. I promise.” He gave my hand a squeeze.

I’m not sure why I believed him. But I stayed.

Being sawn in half wasn’t half bad. I mean, it was actually kind of neat once you got over the disconcerting feeling of looking at your own feet sticking out of a box on the other side of the stage. Yeah, they were my feet, alright. They wiggled and twisted whenever I moved them. I could understand why Debbie ran out screaming after this, but I had no similar inclination. I was not in the least bit of pain, and I trusted that Zucchini would put me back together, good as new. In fact, if I closed my eyes I felt like I was completely normal. It made no sense that I was in two parts. I decided it was better to go with it and disbelieve what my eyes were telling me. It had to be some kind of weird illusion. Had to be.

I could tell Zucchini was impressed by my calm demeanor during the trick. I even forced a few smiles at the audience. I was determined to make a go at my new career. No screaming Banshee, I.

The magician reconnected me as promised and I suffered no ill effects. I climbed out of the box and we took our final bows. As the curtains closed in front of us, The Great Zucchini turned to me and said, “Well done, Miss Parsnip. Welcome to the show.”

“Please, call me Susan.”

“I shall. And you shall call me Barry. When we’re offstage, that is. May I invite you out for a celebratory beverage, Susan?”

“I wouldn’t say no.”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Five gin-and-tonics later, Barry Zucchini decided to tell me his life story.

“My mother was a witch,” he began. “Not your run-of-the-mill bitchy type of witch, you understand. No, she was the real deal. She was a spell-casting, potion-making, wand-twirling, truth-divining type of witch. I knew she was powerful and looked up to her. Perhaps I also feared her a little, but she was never anything but kind to me.”

I took a sip of my drink and asked, “Did she wear a pointy black hat and ride a broom?”

He took my question far more seriously than I had intended it.

“She had a black hat, I believe, but it was round and flat on top. Not pointy at all. And as far as I know, she only used the broom for sweeping the floor. Never for transportation. I don’t know why she would consider traveling on a wooden stick when she could simply teleport herself at will to anyplace she’d like to go.”

“I was joking, Barry.”

“Oh. Yes. I see. Stereotypical witch behavior. Ha ha. Not even remotely accurate in the real world, of course. Ha.”

“And your mother taught you magic?”

“Yes. It took quite a few years, as you might imagine. Teleportation is particularly difficult. You need to have a good understanding of fourth-dimensional geometry, which is hard to learn when your brain is wired to deal with only three dimensions.”

“When I was in the disappearing box, I saw stars all around me. Did you really teleport me into outer space?”

“Not exactly. Your body never moved from its coordinates in three-dimensional space. I simply shifted it ten feet dweebward.”

“Dweebward?”

“Yes. Every time you add a spatial dimension, you add two axes of movement. For example, if you’re a point on a one-dimensional horizontal line, you can only move left or right. If you’re in a two-dimensional plane, you can also move forward or backward. And if you’re in three-dimensional space, you can also move up or down. Four-dimensional space has two additional directions, but you can’t see them in three-dimensional space. I call these directions dweeb and frump. I moved you ten feet dweebward. It’s kind of an alternate universe thing.”

“Huh. Is it dangerous?”

“Not if you don’t stay there for long. But there’s no air to breathe in a vacuum. So if I didn’t bring you back you’d soon suffocate.”

“But I _was_ breathing!”

“That’s because I transported the air inside the box along with you, and prevented it from disbursing into space. You would have used it up eventually. But not to worry. I’d never leave you there for that long.”

“Wow. But you can also transport things in three dimensions, right? Like the seven of hearts? You sent it to that guy’s wallet?”

“That’s very perceptive of you. Yes. Cards are easy to transport because they don’t take up much space.”

“Wow. Can you transport people to other places on Earth too?”

“Yes, but I’d need to be sure there’s nothing in the way on the receiving end. It’s fine when I can see the destination. So popping the lower half of your body into a box on the same stage is no problem for me. But let’s say I wanted to transport you to Piccadilly Circus, London. If someone happened to be standing in the spot I sent you to, things would get a bit, well, messy. Two people or objects trying to inhabit the same space generally don’t get along well, if you see what I mean.”

“I get it. So transporting people on Earth is a no-no, then.”

“I didn’t say that. There are ways to do it. You just have to be careful. For example, certain spaces around the world are guarded by local witches and kept empty. If you want to go there, you send a small object, like a pebble or a pea, over first. If the object reappears, it means the witches will keep the space empty for you for the next five minutes.”

“So as long as you know the space is unoccupied, you can send a person anywhere?”

“Yeah, that’s the gist of it.”

“This is awesome. And aside from transporting things, what else can you do?”

“Ah, well, sometimes I can see the future. But only bits of it, and I can’t choose what I see.”

“Have you seen my future?”

“If I did, I wouldn’t tell you. It’s against the rules.”

“The rules?”

“Witches have rules, like any profession. They’re quite simple. First, do no harm.”

“Like the Doctor’s oath.”

“_Exactly_ like the Doctor’s oath. Hippocrates was a witch.”

“Ah.”

“Second, do not use magic for personal gain.”

“But you get paid to perform it. Isn’t that against the rules?”

“No, I checked with the Witches’ Council. As long as people think it’s just an act, it’s okay to take their money.”

“I see. But if they knew the magic was real, they couldn’t pay you to do it.”

“That’s correct. Nor can I make any financial profit from knowing the future or from selling potions or spells.”

“And you can’t tell other people about their future?”

“No, because telling them might alter it, which is generally held to be a bad thing.”

“Is it _necessarily_ a bad thing?”

“I don’t know. But we err on the side of ‘do no harm’.”

“And what if not telling causes harm?”

“That would be an interesting conundrum, Susan.”

“Should you be sharing all of this with me, Barry?”

He took another drink. “No. Certainly not, my dear. But my excuse is that I’m drunk. And as my new assistant, I trust you implicitly.”

Barry lifted his glass to tap mine, and we both drank to that.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Almost immediately, I betrayed his trust.

I didn’t mean to. But I should have foreseen what would happen when I told my younger brother Fergus about The Great Zucchini’s abilities. He couldn’t wait to inform Ralph Dodgy. And that’s when the trouble started.

I’d had problems with Ralph before. When I got the job as a teller with First Transcontinental Bank, Fergus was quick to brag about it to his low-life childhood friend. Ralph began to brainstorm ways he could use my position inside the bank to his advantage. I managed to give good reasons why each of his harebrained schemes to defraud the bank wouldn’t work. But every couple of months, Ralph would be back with another idea. I finally told him flat out that I was not going to help him rip off my employer, and that I’d report him if he tried anything. That shut him up for a while.

You might be wondering why I put up with him at all. It’s a good question. The answer is that he was my brother’s only friend, and I was afraid of what might happen if he walked away. Fergus had always been a bit mentally challenged. In grade school, Ralph was the only kid who would give him the time of day. Initially, I suspect this was because Ralph figured he could manipulate Fergus, which was true. But over the years a bond developed between the two of them. I didn’t like Ralph, but I must grudgingly admit he was a good friend to Fergus. So I tolerated him. Until the robbery incident.

It happened about six months after I told Ralph to go to hell. I knew something was up because my brother became secretive and uncommunicative for several weeks. Then one night he asked me to stay home from work the next day. When I asked why he just smiled and placed his finger on his lips. He left the apartment, presumably bound for Ralph’s.

I did what any big sister would do. I searched his room. It didn’t take me long to find a plastic Bugs Bunny mask and a loaded gun. Horrified, I threw the mask in the garbage, removed the bullets, and hid the gun in the attic. Then I walked out and used a payphone to leave an anonymous message with the police about a robbery attempt tomorrow at First Transnational. I called the bank manager and left a similar warning on his voicemail, disguising my voice as best I could. When that was done, I returned to the apartment and waited for Fergus to come home so I could tell him what I’d done.

They had no choice but to call off the heist. Fergus didn’t talk to me for several weeks, but I think he knew I had done it for his own good. Ralph didn’t come round to the apartment after that. Still, he remained friends with Fergus, for better or worse.

Once Ralph heard that The Great Zucchini might be the real deal, his little criminal mind started spinning. He showed up on my doorstep with a bunch of flowers and a bottle of scotch, telling me he wanted to bury the hatchet. Fergus urged me to let him in. A few minutes later, Ralph asked about my new job. I knew right away that Fergus had told him about Zucchini.

Not surprisingly, Ralph wanted to meet the magician. I put him off, but one night I spied him and Fergus sitting in the late show audience. Immediately following the final curtain they were knocking on the dressing room door. I gave in and introduced them to my boss.

Copperfield the poodle seemed indifferent to my brother. But when Ralph approached to shake Zucchini’s hand, the little dog started running around in circles and yapping like it was the end of the world. Zucchini had trouble getting him to calm down. _That dog’s a good judge of character_, I thought.

True to form, Ralph was his usual undiplomatic self.

“That was a great show, Mr. Zucchini. Tell me now, you can’t really move objects around with your mind, can you? It’s all some kind of trick, right?”

Barry puffed up and grew red in the face. “My magic is real, Mr. Dodgy. I defy anyone to prove otherwise.” He folded his arms.

“Alright, alright. No need to get all worked up about it. I’m just saying your tricks are very good, is all. I can’t figure out how you did them.”

“They are demonstrations, not tricks. And I performed them using magic.”

“Is that so? Well, why don’t you prove it, then? Can you transport me to the other side of the room, for example?”

“I don’t perform on request, Mr. Dodgy. I’m not a trained seal.”

“I’ll pay you five bucks if you can do it.”

“Keep your money, Mr. Dodgy. You look like you need it more than I do.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Ralph’s hands balled up into fists.

Even my brother realized that this encounter was going south. “Um, Ralph, maybe we should get going now,” he suggested. “It was very nice to meet you, Mr. Zucchini.” Fergus turned to go.

Ralph stood his ground. “I’m not leaving this room until I have proof this old bird can really do magic.”

Sensing the heightened tension in the room, Copperfield started yapping again.

“As you wish,” said The Great Zucchini. He snapped his fingers and Ralph disappeared. Fergus screamed. Copperfield stopped yapping and trotted back to his water bowl.

“Where did you send him?” I asked.

“To a place I knew would be empty at this hour.”

“In New York City? Where could that be?”

Zucchini smiled.

“Let’s just say that I don’t think we’ll be bothered by Mr. Dodgy again.”

Knowing Ralph Dodgy, I figured that Barry was dead wrong.

I later found out from Fergus that Ralph materialized inside the crown of the Statue of Liberty, which was closed for the night. Ralph had to wait until dawn before there was enough light to climb down the 569 steps to the main lobby. Then he waited several hours more for the doors to be unlocked by a very surprised park ranger.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We didn’t hear any more from Ralph for a few weeks. I asked Fergus what his friend was doing, and my brother said he didn’t know. Ralph wouldn’t answer his phone or door.

I knew this was a bad sign. Ralph was planning something, and he didn’t want Fergus to find out what it was. He must have been worried I’d throw a wrench into his plans again. He was right about that. I knew it would have something to do with Zucchini, so I warned Barry to watch out for him. Barry thought I was crazy to be worried about it.

One night after the show, we returned to the dressing room to find an envelope addressed to Barry propped up on his vanity table. Barry opened it and became very still.

“Copperfield?” he called.

There was no response. Not a single yap.

“Copperfield!” he yelled.

Nothing. He sat down heavily in the chair and handed me the letter. It was typed in all capital letters. I don’t know why Ralph bothered. It’s not like we didn’t know it was from him.

TO THE GREAT ZUCCHINI:

I HAVE YOUR DOG.

IT’S SAFE FOR NOW.

IF YOU DO WHAT I WANT, THE MUTT WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU UNHARMED.

IF NOT, THE DOG IS DEAD.

I WILL BE IN TOUCH SOON. DON’T DO ANYTHING STUPID WHEN YOU SEE ME.

P.S. - IF I MAKE ANOTHER TRIP TO THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, OR IF ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS TO ME, YOUR DOG WILL NOT BE FED, AND IT WILL DIE.

I put down the note, praying that Fergus wasn’t involved in this. I looked at Barry.

“Can’t you magic him back?” I asked.

“Not without knowing where he is,” said Barry. “Do you have any idea where Dodgy might have taken him?”

“Not offhand,” I replied. “I’m sure he’s not in Ralph’s apartment, though. That’s the first place we would look.”

“We should check anyway.”

“Yeah. I’ll talk to my brother about it.”

“Susan, you don’t think Fergus is mixed up in this, do you?”

“No. Absolutely not,” I hoped.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“I can’t believe Ralph would steal a puppy,” Fergus said. “That doesn’t sound like him at all.”

_No, he doesn’t steal puppies but armed bank robbery is fine with him_, I thought. But seeing that my brother was moderately distressed, I decided not to press the point.

“Do you think he could be keeping the dog in his apartment?” I asked.

“I ain’t been inside Ralph’s apartment since he visited Miss Liberty. But I been standing outside a few times and if he had a dog in there I think I’d have heard him. The dog, I mean.”

“Can you think of anyplace else he might have taken it?”

“Um, no. But I’ll try his apartment again and see if he’ll talk to me.”

“Okay, Fergus, let me know if you find anything out.”

“Yup, will do, sis.”

Zucchini and I had a show that night, so I left shortly afterward. I arrived backstage and was surprised to find the magician in a heated argument with Ralph.

“…and I tell you again, I can’t send you into a space that I haven’t seen beforehand. It would be incredibly dangerous. Even if we know it’s unoccupied, you could materialize inside a wall or a table or some other object, which would kill you instantly.”

“You sent me to the Statue of Liberty!”

“_Because I’ve been there!_ I know what the space looks like. I know it’s empty. There is plenty of room to work with and no objects that could impale a person when they pop in.”

“What if I’m willing to take that risk?”

“Then you’re an idiot. But I still wouldn’t do it. I don’t want to live with the death of somebody on my conscience. Not even you. Oh, hello Susan. Can you please try to talk some sense into this moron? He wants me to magic him into a bank vault, unseen.”

“Hey,” said Ralph, “are you forgetting I have your dog?”

“I know you kidnapped my dog, and if you kill him it will be your doing, not mine. I can’t control what awful things you may do. But I can definitely refuse to run the risk of taking a life myself. Besides, if you were to die, then my dog would presumably follow.”

I decided to intervene and buy us some time. “There is a simple solution to this problem. Go and see the space.”

“And how am I to do that?” Zucchini asked.

“It’s easy. Go to the bank tomorrow and ask to rent a safe deposit box. They’ll bring you right into the vault.”

“No,” said Ralph. “The heist needs to happen tonight. If I leave you two alone, how do I know you won’t warn the bank and the police ahead of time? Right, Susan? You’re not going to screw up this job like you did the last one.”

“First of all, Ralph, since you’re not involving my brother this time, I don’t care what you do. Second, ratting on you won’t get Barry’s dog back. And third, what exactly would we tell the cops? That you’re going to suddenly appear inside a locked vault, steal some stuff, and then suddenly disappear with the loot? Come on.”

Ralph was not completely stupid, even though some of his actions begged the question. He calculated the relative risks and agreed to a one-day postponement.

“I’ll be back tomorrow night, then. Same time. And you’d better be ready.”

“Wait just a minute. How do I know my dog is even still alive?”

“I thought you might ask that. Here, have a look.”

Ralph reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a Polaroid photo of Copperfield sitting on a copy of this morning’s paper.

“Satisfied?” Ralph sneered.

“Bring another photograph tomorrow. Better yet, bring the dog. I give you my word I will keep my end of the bargain.”

“No way, Zucchini. I’ll bring the photo, but you’ll get the pooch when I’ve got the loot. Not before.”

As he walked out, Ralph turned to me and said, “Tell Fergus I’m sorry I haven’t been able to see him lately. He can swing by after this gig tomorrow night.”

“I’ll tell him,” I said. _When hell freezes over_, I added in my thoughts. Ralph left.

I looked at Barry. “Well, we have one more day to find Copperfield. Can I have that photo?”

“I’m not sure what good this will be.” He tossed me the picture.

“I don’t either, but it’s a clue. Anyway, let’s get ready. We’ve got a show to do.”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning, Zucchini went to the bank to get a safety deposit box and check out the vault. Meanwhile, I showed the photo of the dog to Fergus in the hope it would trigger a breakthrough. It was admittedly a longshot.

A longshot which paid off handsomely, I should add.

“I know that purple-ish wall color,” Fergus said. “That’s Aunt Martha’s place.”

“What?”

“Ralph’s Aunt Martha. I met her a few times. She lives in Hoboken, New Jersey. Wood floor, purple walls. Yeah, that’s her place.”

“I don’t believe it,” I said.

“Why would I lie to you, Susan?”

“No, Fergus, I mean that it’s pretty amazing how you figured out where Mr. Zucchini’s dog is by just looking at that photo.”

“Oh. Yeah. It’s at Aunt Martha’s place.”

“Do you know the address, Fergus?”

He furrowed his brow. “Um. No.”

“How about her last name?”

“Oh! Oh! I do know that. It’s Martha. First name Aunt, last name Martha.”

This was not exactly the answer I’d been looking for. I hoped Martha might have the same last name as Ralph, but there was no telephone listing in Hoboken for a Martha Dodgy. I got off the line with the operator and put my head in my hands.

“How come you’re upset, Sis?”

“I want to recover Barry’s dog, but I don’t know where Aunt Martha lives.”

“Oh! Oh! I know that. She lives in Hoboken.”

“Yes, Fergus, but where in Hoboken?”

“Oh! Oh! I know that!”

“I thought you didn’t know her address.”

“I don’t. But I know where she lives.”

“You’re saying you can find her place?”

“Oh! Yes! I know how to get there from the train station. You walk straight, then turn left at the ice cream store, then right at Woolworth’s, then …”

“Hold that thought, Fergus. Let’s go.”

It cost a small fortune, but in the interest of time, we hired a cab to take us to Hoboken. Starting from the train station, Fergus gave the driver directions. We ended up at a slightly disheveled apartment complex and asked the cabbie to wait.

Martha knew Fergus, and she buzzed us in. We could hear Copperfield’s yapping before we even reached her third-floor apartment. When she opened the door, our mouths started watering at the smell of chocolate chip cookies.

Aunt Martha grabbed Fergus by the hand and pulled him inside. I followed.

“Fergus, it’s so nice to see you! What a surprise. And who is this lovely lady with you?”

“Oh, this is my sister, Susan. Susan, this is Aunt Martha.”

“Pleased to meet you, ma’am,” I said.

“I’ve just pulled some cookies out of the oven. Come and sit down.”

Fergus started to move toward the table but I put up my hand. “I don’t want to be ungracious, Aunt Martha, but we have a cab waiting downstairs with the meter running. We only stopped by to pick up the dog.”

“Oh, really? Ralph was here this morning and he didn’t mention anything about that.”

“Just a change of plans, ma’am. The dog’s owner came back from vacation early, so Ralph asked us to come over and retrieve him.”

“Oh, and we were beginning to get along so well.”

“Yes, and thank you so much for watching him. But we’d best get moving. I’m sorry. Next time we visit, we’ll stay longer.”

Aunt Martha helped us to attach Copperfield’s leash and she wrapped up some cookies for our journey. We thanked her again and headed back to the city with the dog in tow. I dropped off Fergus at the apartment and continued to the theater. I paid the driver and gave him a couple of chocolate chip cookies.

Barry was thrilled to be reunited with Copperfield, who kept up a constant stream of yaps as he ran back and forth around the dressing room.

“Thank you so much for finding my dog, Susan. Now, my dear, what shall we do about the nefarious Mr. Dodgy?”

“We need to send him away, or he’ll just keep trying to find a way to get what he wants.”

“That’s what I thought as well. But he’s your brother’s friend, is he not?”

“I’ll deal with Fergus. But Ralph is getting more and more dangerous.”

“Very well. I will take care of it.”

“You won’t harm him, will you?”

“Of course not. Not physically, anyway. Now please take Copperfield out of the room. Ralph will be here soon, and I don’t want him to know that I have recovered my dog. Come back in an hour.”

I took Copperfield for a long walk and we relaxed in a park. When I returned to the theater, Barry informed me that we shouldn’t expect to see Ralph for quite a long time, if ever again.

“Where did you send him?”

“Ah, you remember I told you about certain spaces around the world that are kept empty for popping people in and out? I sent him to one of those.”

“Where, exactly?”

“It’s a small village near Lake Tanganyika. In central Africa. And oh, would you mind disposing of these?” He handed me a bag. I looked inside.

“Wait. You sent him to Africa without his clothes?”

“More importantly, I sent him without his wallet. Don’t worry, it’s warm there and the locals won’t let him freeze or starve. But I figured this was the best way to slow down his return. He has no money and no identification. I expect he’ll be gone for several years at least.”

I wasn’t sure we’d heard the last of Ralph Dodgy, but I was pleased that he’d be away for a while.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fergus was livid when he heard his friend had been sent to Africa, even though he understood that Ralph had stepped over a line with the puppy kidnapping. Still, he insisted that Ralph never would have harmed the dog, despite his threats. I wasn’t so sure but I declined to argue the point. Fergus eventually got over his anger with me, but he never spoke to Barry again and would quickly leave the apartment whenever my boss showed up.

Barry and I did pretty well with the show over the next few years. We even went on a couple of road tours, hitting smaller theaters in out-of-the-way towns across the Midwest. I thought we could have done even better, and I suggested that maybe Barry should up the ante by performing more spectacular demonstrations. But he wasn’t interested. He said he just wanted to make a decent living and that the other true magicians around the world would be upset if he drew too much attention to himself. He told me there would be “negative repercussions” if he got too famous doing real magic. He became nervous even discussing it and I dropped the topic.

Three years after the pupnapping incident, I saw someone who looked like Ralph crossing Madison Avenue downtown. He was thinner and had a darker complexion than I remembered, but I was pretty sure it was him. He boarded a bus before I could catch up to confirm.

Barry was dismissive when I told him. “I’m sure you were mistaken, Susan. And even if it was Mr. Dodgy, I expect he’s learned his lesson. We won’t be hearing from him again.”

The following week, my fears materialized in the form of Ralph Dodgy, who stood in my apartment doorway holding a gun. Fergus had let him in. There was a crazed look in Ralph’s eyes.

“Back up. Both of you.”

“I’m glad to see you again, Ralph,” said my brother. “Are you okay? I’ve been worried about you.”

“Shut up, Fergus.”

Barry pointed the gun at me. “Where is he, Susan? He’s not performing at the same theater anymore.”

“Ralph, why can’t you just let it go?” I asked.

“Let it go? That creep made my life hell. He sent me naked to the middle of Africa!”

“Because you kidnapped his dog and threatened to kill it if he didn’t help you rob a bank!”

“The magician must die. I’m going to plug him before he sees me. The bullet will come out of nowhere when he least expects it. I’m going to kill his dog, too. NOW, WHERE IS HE, SUSAN?”

The hand holding the gun was shaking badly. I feared for my life.

What happened next was very fast. Fergus made a lunge at Ralph, who swung the gun around and fired. My brother was hit in the shoulder and he fell to the floor. Ralph turned the gun back to me. I snapped my fingers.

Ralph disappeared.

The gun and the clothes he had been wearing dropped empty to the floor.

I rushed to my brother.

“What? How did you do that?” he asked.

_… eight … nine … ten_, I counted to myself. I snapped my fingers a second time.

“Barry has been teaching me a few things,” I said. “It turns out I have a knack for magic.”

“Where did you send him?”

“Back to Africa. But first, I sent him five feet dweebward and left him there for ten seconds. That should have been enough to scare the living daylights out of him without killing him. Hopefully, it will convince him not to try this again.”

“Dweebward?”

“It’s in the fourth dimension. An alternate universe … Oh, never mind. Let’s get you to the hospital.”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thankfully, my brother’s wound turned out to be non-life threatening. We got rid of Ralph’s clothes and gun. We told the police that Ralph Dodgy had gotten into an argument with my brother and shot him, then ran away. The police looked for him and found the small studio he was living in, but Ralph never returned to it.

Barry was extremely upset by our close call and apologized for not taking my warning more seriously. He insisted that my quick thinking had saved his life, and said he would somehow find a way to repay me. I told him not to worry about it.

We continued our show, which we now billed as The Great Zucchini and The Magical Parsnip. We became moderately famous, but not _too_ famous.

Copperfield passed away in his sleep ten years later. Both Barry and I were heartbroken over it, but the poodle had had a good life.

It was several years later when The Great Zucchini was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. It turns out that magic can’t prevent aging or disease.

Fergus and I watched over Barry as he lay in his hospital bed. The doctors had told us the end would be coming soon. Barry asked me to hand him the deck of cards on the table. He fanned the cards and said, “Choose one, and don’t tell me what it is.”

I selected the four of clubs.

“Here. Take the rest of the cards and shuffle it into the deck.”

I did so.

“Now look for your card and show it to me.”

I flipped through the deck.

“It’s not here,” I said.

“Yes I know,” he replied. “I expect it will turn up someday, though. I’m afraid I need to be going, Susan. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to know you, my dear.”

I took his hand and tried to hold back my tears. Fergus placed his hand on my shoulder.

“Give my regards to your granddaughter,” Barry said.

“I don’t have a granddaughter. Or a daughter. Or a husband, come to think of it,” I said.

“You will,” said the magician.

I smiled. “Hey, you’re not breaking the rules, are you? I thought future telling was off-limits.”

He smiled back. “I owe you. And I’ve never been great at following rules, Susan.”

He closed his eyes. Five minutes later, he stopped breathing and the machines started beeping. Doctors and nurses rushed into the room, but there was nothing they could do.

“He never finished his card trick,” said Fergus.

“It wasn’t a trick, Fergus. It was a demonstration. And I expect to see the four of clubs again. It’s simply a matter of time.”
