The horizon shimmered in the hundred-degree desert heat as Officer William “Bull” Pupp stepped from his patrol car into the dry furnace otherwise known as Tuba City, Arizona. He scanned the scene. Apart from the road, there was nothing here but dirt, cactus and burrow weed. Pupp walked toward the group of white jump-suited technicians who were cordoning off the area around the body.

The coroner was kneeling over the deceased. He looked up as Pupp approached. “Hot enough for you, Bull?”

“If you can’t stand the heat you shouldn’t be living here, Tom. Wadda we got?”

Tom looked back down at the body, which was lying face down in the sand. “Caucasian female, aged approximately 45. She has a depressed skull fracture on the parietal bone, which almost certainly was the cause of death. I’ll confirm this in the lab. There are several other contusions on her skull and shoulders.”

“So she was beaten to death?”

“No. The other contusions are older. I believe she was killed by a single blow to the back of the head by a blunt object.”

Bull nodded and wiped the sweat off his brow with his sleeve. “What kind of object, do you think?”

“Again, I’ll confirm this in the lab, but I think that the murder weapon is right over there,“ Tom points. “In that creosote bush.”

Bull crouched down and examined the blood-stained cuboid. “A brick… Jesus. He hit her in the head with a brick?”

“We don’t know it that it was a man, yet. And I suspect the brick may have been thrown at her from the road. When I arrived, there were no footprints in this area, apart from her own.“

“No footprints? Who found her, then?”

“Apparently, some guy noticed her body as he drove by. He telephoned 911 from his car and didn’t give his name. The guy drove off without even bothering to get out and see if she was alive.”

“I assume we got the phone number, though? I’ll track down the bastard. He might even be the perp.”

“Not going to happen, Bull. It was a burner phone. Untraceable.”

Officer Pupp cursed softly. He gauged the distance to the road and whistled. “If the killer threw that brick, he had quite an arm and incredible accuracy.”

Tom decided to let the gender assumption slide this time. “Yeah, I know. But that’s all I can figure. The ground around her wasn’t disturbed at all.”

Bull scratched his head. “What was she doing out here? There’s nothing around for several miles. How did she get here?”

“Dunno. Maybe she walked. Or perhaps she drove out here with her killer.”

Bull grimaced and looked toward the mountains. “Any identification on her?”

“Nothing yet. But there could be something underneath the body. I was just about to turn her over when you arrived.”

“Well, Tom, go ahead then. It ain’t gettin’ any cooler out here.”

Tom signaled to two technicians who reached down and carefully flipped the body onto its back. A small pocketbook lay underneath. More photos were taken. When they were done, Tom picked up the purse and looked inside.

“Driver’s license identifies her as Katherine Herriman. She lived in Tonalea, just down the road. Oh, and here’s her cellphone.”

Officer Pupp pulled on some latex gloves and gently took the phone. He pushed a few buttons. “It’s not locked. The last number she called was to a woman named Lil Ainjil. The phone’s got an address for her. I’ll go and check it out.” He placed the evidence into a plastic baggie and sealed it, then slipped it into his pocket. “I may need this for questioning,” he said. “You got anything else before I take off?”

“Nope. I’ll call you later, after I complete the post mortem.”

“Sounds good. Thanks, Tom. And, hey, use more sunscreen. The back of your neck is pretty red.”

“Yeah, ok. See ya, Bull.”

…&…

Officer Pupp turned off Caliche Road into the pebbled driveway and double-checked the house number before getting out of his car. The house was tiny and looked like it could easily be blown away in a strong wind. The garden was tastefully adorned with broken toys, empty beer cans, and tumbleweeds. He rang the doorbell but didn’t hear any corresponding sound inside. He banged on the door.

After a moment, a petite woman of indeterminate age answered the knock in a grey housecoat and slippers and took a drag on her cigarette. “Yeah? Waddaya want?” She exhaled smoke in Officer Pupp’s general direction.

“Good morning,” replied Officer Pupp. “Would you be Ms. Ainjil?”

The woman’s eyebrows lifted until they almost reached her scalp. “Who? You got the wrong address, Hon.”

“I’m looking for someone who goes by the name of Lil Ainjil. Short for Lily, perhaps? Does she live here?”

“Never heard of her, Officer. You got your wires crossed. It’s just my husband and me, and our three boys.” She looked back into the house and yelled, ”MILTON! GET DOWN OFF OF THERE AND UNTIE YOUR BROTHER RIGHT NOW! AND MARSHALL, DON’T THINK I DON’T SEE THAT FLAME THROWER! PUT IT AWAY!”

She turned back toward Officer Pupp and took another draw on the cigarette. Her eyes narrowed.

“Would you mind giving me your name, Ma’am?”

“No. I’m using it. Anyway, why would you want my name? Ain’t you got one of your own?”

Pupp has to think about this. “No… I don’t want to adopt your name. I just want to know who I’m speaking with.”

“Oh. Why didn’tcha say so? It’s Mauss. Magnolia Mauss. We’re the Mauss family. Lived here for fifteen years or so. Never heard tell of no Lily Ainjil. We done now?” Ms. Mauss swung her head back. “IRVING! I TOLD YOU NOT TO FEED THAT RAT POISON TO THE DOG! PUT IT DOWN!” She returned her gaze to Officer Pupp. “I asked if we wuz done.”

Looking confused, Officer Pupp nodded and started to leave. Then he turned back. “Hold on. Do you happen to recognize this phone number, Ma’am?” He pulled Katherine Herriman’s phone out of his pocket. He pushed a few buttons without opening the plastic and held the phone up to Magnolia’s face.

Magnolia squinted at the small screen. “That’s my husband’s cell number. But he sure ain’t no ‘Lil Ainjil,’ that’s fer sure. Whose phone is that, anyway? What’s this all about?”

“I’m afraid I can’t say, Ma’am. Is your husband home? I’d like to speak with him.”

She took a final draw on the cigarette and threw the stub into the yard. “He ain’t here. He’s gone to the brick factory.”

“Thank you, Ma’am. And what is your husband’s name?”

“Ignatz. Ignatz Mauss.” She swung around. “HEY! PUT THOSE GOLDFISH BACK IN THE BOWL THIS INSTANT, AND TURN OFF THAT DAMN BUZZ SAW!” She slammed the door behind her without even wishing Officer Pupp a good day.

…&…

Colin Kerry’s Brickyard was just a few miles further up Highway 160. A portable signboard out front read, “Best bricks in Coconino County! All sizes and colors, but only one shape. Buy twelve and get the thirteenth free!”

Pupp parked his car and walked into the main showroom. He approached the woman behind the counter. She looked up from the Sunday comics and donned her best fake smile, saying, “Good morning Offissa, are you interested in some designer bricks? We’re running a special on Red Clay this month.”

Bull shook his head no, and her smile shrugged and went outside for a smoke. The woman herself remained, sans smile, waiting for an explanation.

“Police business, Ma’am. I’m looking for a man named Ignatz Mauss. Is he an employee here by any chance?”

“Ignatz?” the woman chuckled, “Ignatz ain’t no employee. He’s one of our best customers. Or would be, if he ever paid his bills on time. I think he’s in back, on the practice range.”

“Practice range?”

“Yeah, we built it just for him. Out back. You can’t miss it. But make sure you shout out that you’re coming before you turn the corner.”

Officer Pupp tilted his head quizzically and thanked the woman. He sauntered outside and nodded to the smoking smile, which studiously ignored him. As he approached the back of the building, he heard a heavy clunking sound that repeated every couple of seconds, followed by alternating exclamations of “Dat’s the ticket!” and “Aw, Krap!” A handwritten sign on the wall stated, “Anownce Useff Orr Suffa Da Conchequenches!”

“Hello?” Pupp shouted. The clunking stopped.

“Come thru,” a voice responded.

Pupp turned the corner to see a group of wooden posts at varying distances, with circular targets painted on their tops. The ground around them was littered with bricks. Standing about ten yards away and facing him was a man holding a brick, with a pile of bricks stacked neatly at his side.

“Um, would you be Ignatz Mauss, by any chance?”

“Who wants to know, and why’s he want to know?”

“I’m Police Officer Bull Pupp. I have a few questions for Mr. Mauss. Is that you?”

Ignatz (for indeed it was he) scratched his unshaven chin and said cagily, “Ah mebbe. An’ ah meh not be. Axe yer questions and we’ll see.”

“Do you know a Ms. Katherine Herriman?”

“Kat? Dat Crazy woman? ‘Course ah knows her. Wish ah didn’t.”

“You wish you didn’t? Why is that, Mr. Mauss?”

“’Cause she’s always chasin’ after me, is why. Calls me her lil’ ainjil. Drives me crazy. Ah try to convince her to keep her distance, but it’s never any use. She seems to LIKE getting’ hit in the head with bri…” He stops short and corrects himself. “Ah mean, she seems to like bein’ politely asked to go away. Very politely and properly, without any bricks at all. Anyways, why are you axin’ about her?”

“Ms. Herriman was killed this morning, after being struck by a brick in the back of her head.”

Ignatz laughs. “Nah. Nah. Dat can’t be. Ah don’t believe it. A brick to the back of her head wouldn’t kill her. Ah should know. Ah throwed enuf of dem, ah can tell you.”

“You admit that you threw bricks at her?”

“Sure. Plenty. But it ain’t never hurt her none. She seems to like me even more after ah do it. Like ah said, she’s Krazy. Krazy Kat, ah call her.”

“Well, Mr. Mauss, you’re going to need to come along with me. You’re under arrest for first-degree murder. I’m afraid this time your brick hit its mark a little too well.”

“Aw, Krap!” exclaims Ignatz.

Officer Pupp handcuffs Ignatz and marches him to the squad car. Once he’s inside, Bull’s phone begins to ring.

“Officer Pupp here.”

“Bull? It’s Tom. You…you won’t believe this.”

“What’s up, Tom?”

“Katherine Herriman. She’s…not…technically…dead.”

“What??”

“When I got back to the lab, she was sitting up on the gurney and rubbing the back of her head. I can’t explain it. I thought for sure that she was a goner. I’d swear she had no pulse. It’s the darndest thing. Anyway, she knows who threw the brick, and she doesn’t want to press charges against him.”

“I’ve got the guy right here in the back of my squad car. She doesn’t have to press charges. He’s going to jail for this, for sure.”

“You’ve got him?... Wait a sec… What’s that, Ms. Herriman?... Um, Bull, Ms. Herriman is with me and asks to talk to the man. Can you put your phone on speaker?”

Bull does, and a high-pitched voice rings out. “Ignatz? Is that you, my love? My Lil’ Ainjil? I got your gift. Thank you sooo much.”

“Aw, Krap!” mutters Ignatz.
