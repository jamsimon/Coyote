Roy Bottoms handed over his last twenty dollar bill in exchange for a slip of paper documenting his bet on the tenth race at Meadowlands. He wandered off towards the viewing stands. Given how his luck had soured tonight, he wasn’t even sure that he wanted to watch the event. He might just as well have flushed that twenty down the toilet, he thought.

He sat down heavily on the bench, wondering how he was going to explain the theft of the five hundred in cash to his mother. He had fully intended to replace the money out of this evening’s winnings. His plan would have succeeded beautifully had there been any winnings.

Roy glumly watched the stallions line up at the gate. Last Gasp, the horse he had bet on to win, was an extreme longshot. But at 50 to 1, it was the only chance he had to recover his mother’s money and save himself from (at best) a severe tongue-lashing and (at worst) an eviction notice, which his asshole brother-in-law would be only too happy to enforce. Not that he’d mind moving out of his mother’s house. Except for the fact that he had no money and no place to go.

Head hung low, Roy noticed a pink card on the ground which was partially covered. It appeared to read, “You’re going to win, Roy” He picked it up and on closer inspection it actually said,

**Having a hard time lately? Don’t despair!**

**You’re going to win royally with the advice of Dr. Iko Sahedron, mystic and seer from the East.**

**Ask your burning questions, and be answered!**

**This is your ticket to win!**

The loudspeakers suddenly blared with the sound of a pre-recorded trumpet.

_… and they’re off! Eat My Dust, the favorite, is off to an early lead! He’s followed by Soggy Biscuits and Tweet This, with Last Gasp running fourth in surprisingly strong form. As they circle the bend, Over Confident passes Last Gasp and challenges Tweet This for third place. Busted Radiator is coming up now from the outside, putting pressure on Last Gasp._

_Wait! Eat My Dust is in trouble! Yes, he seems to be slowing down considerably and has developed a distinct limp. He’s out of it now, for sure. Soggy Biscuits takes the lead, followed closely by Over Confident and Tweet This. Last Gasp is back in fourth position again, but looking tired, with Busted Radiator fast on his tail._

_But what’s this? Busted Radiator seems to be trying to bite Last Gasp in the butt. His jockey doesn’t know what to do. And there’s the bite! Last Gasp suddenly lurches forward, almost knocking his jockey off the saddle. He’s passing Over Confident and he bumps Tweet This against the rail. He’s in a panic, folks! You don’t want to be in front of that horse right now. They’re approaching the finish, and it’s going to be close. Last Gasp and Soggy Biscuits are nose to nose. I can't tell who's ahead from this angle._

_And that’s it! The race is over! A surprise win by Last Gasp! Soggy Biscuits is second, and Over Confident takes third place. Oh, my! Last Gasp has fallen! He’s down. Luckily his jockey was able to jump free before the horse trapped him underneath. It’s pandemonium out there, folks! The veterinarians are rushing to the scene…_

Roy was no longer paying attention. He couldn’t believe his good fortune. He’d now be able to replace his mother’s money, and clear a $500 profit for himself. Being of a superstitious nature, he kissed Dr. Sahedron’s card and placed it in his pocket. Then he set off to collect his winnings.

**???**

Roy looked again at the address on the reverse side of the card.

Dr. Iko Sahedron

888 Spheroid Road

(Above the Pool Hall)

By Appointment Only – 1-800-888-8000

Yeah, this was it. Roy entered the building and walked past the pool hall entrance towards the stairs. On the second floor landing, Roy approached the only door. It was covered with black lacquer, upon which were painted three question marks in bright red, green, and blue. Next to the door were a button and a small card which read, “Dr. Iko Sahedron - Please ring.” Roy reached up to press the buzzer but before he could touch it, the door opened by itself.

The elderly woman behind the reception desk stared at him in an oddly fixated manner. Roy felt uncomfortable and stuttered, “Um, hello? M-m-my name is…”

“Roy Bottoms," finished the woman. "We know. You have a 1 o’clock appointment with the Doctor. Have you prepared your questions?”

“My questions?”

“Didn’t I explain this when you made your appointment? Oh, I must be getting senile. You get to ask him three yes-or-no questions for five hundred dollars. There are some questions that he either cannot or will not answer. If you ask one of these, you will be permitted to ask another question. The Doctor will tell you how many questions you have left. Phrase your queries carefully because he will answer them literally. Once you have asked and received answers to three questions, your session is over. There are no refunds. Do not complain if the answers are not what you wish to hear, or if you didn’t ask the right questions. We don’t care. You must pay upfront. Now, please. No personal checks.”

Although Roy was not sure that he had made the right decision in coming here, he took his $500 winnings out of his pocket and placed them on the counter. The woman counted the money and put it in the safe behind her desk. She smiled and said, “Thank you. You may go in now.” She pushed a button on the wall and the inner door opened. Roy entered, and the door closed behind him.

“No way!” he exclaimed as he passed the threshold.

**???**

The room was empty apart from a red and gold carpet, upon one end of which was placed a leather armchair. This was presumably meant for him. Dr. Iko Sahedron was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the room, facing the chair. But he was not seated on a chair. Or upon the floor. Or upon anything. The man appeared to be floating in mid-air. He was white-haired and bearded, dark-skinned, and dressed in an Indian robe and turban. He smiled and pointed toward the chair. Roy sat down.

“Wow. That’s got to be a trick with mirrors, right?”

Dr. Sahedron closed his eyes. He reopened them and said, ”My reply is no. You have two questions remaining.” And he smiled.

“Damn it. Seriously?”

Dr. Sahedron closed his eyes.

“ … No, wait, I didn’t mean … Crap.”

The Doctor opened his eyes and said, “It is decidedly so. You have one question remaining.” He smiled.

All right, thought Roy. I’ve got to make this good.

“Which horse will win the first race at Meadowlands tomorrow?”

Dr. Sahedron frowned and said, “You must ask only yes-or-no questions. You have one question remaining.” And he smiled.

Roy sat quietly for a few moments. Then he asked. “Will Apple stock go up tomorrow?”

Dr. Sahedron closed his eyes. He reopened them and said, ”Concentrate and ask again. You have one question remaining.” He smiled.

Exacerbated, Roy rephrased, “Will the stock price of Apple Corporation increase tomorrow?”

After the same routine, the answer returned. “You may rely on it. You have no questions remaining.” And Dr. Sahedron smiled. And disappeared in a puff of smoke.

Roy jumped out of his chair, and ran toward the spot where the Doctor had been levitating. He waved his arms around. There was nothing there but air. He scanned the room for hidden projectors but saw nothing.

“What the hell?” he exclaimed.

A disembodied voice responded, “I said that you have no questions remaining.” The door swung open.

Roy walked out of the room, stunned. He approached the receptionist and asked, “Was that for real back there?”

The receptionist said, “Yup. He’s the real deal.”

Roy rushed out to place a buy order for $50,000 of Apple stock, using his mother’s account. He’d sell it at the end of the day tomorrow and pocket the profits. She’d never even know it happened.

**???**

Except it didn’t quite work out that way. After an initial rise in the stock market, the Federal Reserve announced an unexpected hike in interest rates. The stock market tanked, carrying Apple down along with it. At the end of the day, Apple stock was down ten percent.

Roy was livid. He ran back to the Doctor’s office and demanded his money back. The receptionist folded her arms and said, “No refunds.”

“But he was wrong! He lied to me!”

The receptionist did not budge. “He is never wrong. You simply asked the wrong question, and you misunderstood the answer.”

“I just asked him if Apple stock would go up today. It went down ten percent!”

The receptionist sighed. “Did the stock price increase at any point DURING the day?”

“Yes, but…”

“Then his answer was correct. I warned you to be careful with your phrasing, Mr. Bottoms. He answers all questions truthfully, _exactly as asked_. And as I said yesterday, there are no refunds. Now, would you like to make another appointment and see if you can get it right this time?”

Roy debated with himself. This seemed like a scam. But he’d seen the guy disappear into thin air. That had to mean he was on the level, didn’t it? He’d just have to be super careful with his questions next time. Then he thought of the perfect thing to ask.

“OK. Yeah. When’s his next opening?”

**???**

Later that week, Roy re-stole his mother’s $500 and used it to pay for another session. As before, the Doctor floated in the middle of the room. His steadfast smile was beginning to get on Roy’s nerves. But Roy was resolved to say nothing except for the three questions he had carefully prepared.

“Am I named in my mother’s last will and testament?”

Eyes closed. Eyes open. “Yes. You have two questions remaining.” Creepy smile.

“If she were to die, would my sister and I inherit her money?”

Eyes closed. Open. “As I see it, yes. You have one question remaining.” Questioning smile.

“If I were to kill her, would I get away with it?”

Closed. Open. “Better not tell you now. You have one question remaining.” Concerned smile.

“If I were to kill her, would I go to jail?”

Closed. Open. “My sources say no. You have no questions remaining.” No smile. No smile at all. Then puff. Gone.

**???**

After Roy left the office, the receptionist got up and went into the inner room.

“So will he be returning again?” she asked.

“Don’t count on it,” the voice replied.

**???**

Roy finished applying the coat of furniture oil to the wooden landing at the top of the stairs. He left some room along the left edge, which is where he intended to plant his own feet. With any luck, he wouldn’t even be in the house when the accident happened. He’d be careful to talk to as many people as he could while he was out, to solidify his alibi.

He stood up and carefully stepped to the left before descending the stairs. Mother should be pleased, he thought. She’s always telling me I need to help clean the house.

A few minutes later, he shouted up the stairs, “Mother? I’m going out now. I left some scrambled eggs on the stove for you.”

There was no answer. That was unusual.

“Mother?” he called. “Don’t you want any breakfast?”

No response. Roy shrugged and climbed the stairs, stepping to the side as he reached the landing. He knocked on her bedroom door. “Mother?”

Not a sound.

He entered and approached the bed. He knew she was dead even before he touched the cold body to check for a pulse. This is brilliant, he thought. Death by natural causes. I’ll be in the clear for sure. All I have to do is clean up the furniture oil at the top of the steps and call 911. He went downstairs to get some turpentine and a scrub brush.

He whistled an old show tune as he returned to the landing. He swung around and crouched in front of the slippery floor. “Well, I hope she’s in a better place now,” he said to himself. “I wonder if she is?”

“Without a doubt,” a voice behind him replied.

Roy took in a sharp breath and swung his head back to see Dr. Sahedron floating in the hallway. Reflexively, he jumped up and stepped back. And slipped on the oil. He was too shocked to even register any pain as he tumbled down the hard steps. He figured the pain would come later. And he would have been correct in that assumption had not his neck snapped when he reached the bottom of the stairs.

The next thing Roy knew, he was floating in mid-air. He looked down at his prone body. His head should really not be facing that direction, he thought. “Well, that sucks for me,” he said.

“Yes, definitely.” Dr. Sahedron replied, floating beside him.

“This is all YOUR fault! So what happens now? Do I have to float around here forever?”

“Very doubtful,” the Doctor stated. “Outlook not so good.”

Roy felt his soul being sucked downward. “Wait! I didn’t even kill her! I can’t be punished for just _thinking_ something, can I?”

“Signs point to yes, Roy.” And Dr. Sahedron laughed loudly as Roy fell through the floor and into darkness.
