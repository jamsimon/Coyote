Mr. Dingle pressed the intercom button on his desk. “Miss Gibbons, please send in the next applicant.”

“Your final appointment just called to cancel,” said Miss Gibbons, “but there’s a walk-in here. I’m not sure if …”

“Send him in, please.”

The door opened and an extremely large and muscular man entered, wearing a skin-tight, highly reflective suit that looked like latex, but wasn’t. The outfit was all black, except for the central image on his torso of an orange wooden club. The man carried a club that appeared to be oddly similar to the one pictured on his chest. His face was masked.

“Ah, I see you have coronavirus protection,” said Mr. Dingle. “Very good, very good. Shall I wear my mask as well?”

“As you wish,” said the applicant.

Dingle opened his desk drawer and removed a cloth mash adorned with amateur drawings of bunnies. He put it on and smiled, although you could no longer see the smile on account of the bunnies.

“My daughter made this. Fifth-grade project,” he said.

“Very nice,” said the applicant.

“Please, take a seat.” Mr. Dingle took out a pen and a form. “Well, then. Name?”

“I am Kron. Destroyer of Worlds.”

The room itself seemed to tremble as he spoke. Mr. Dingle didn’t notice.

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Kron. First name?”

Kron paused. “Almighty,” he said.

“Almighty. That’s an unusual forename. I suppose people call you ‘Al’ for short?”

“No. Not really.”

“And ‘Destroyer of Worlds,’ was that your previous job title?”

“Yes.”

“Company name?”

“I was employed by the Seven Harbingers of Universal Chaos. Their headquarters are in the Galaxy of Ohmigod Three.”

“Can you spell that galaxy name for me, please?”

“It’s like the expression ‘Oh, my God’ with no spaces and an ‘i’ instead of a ‘y’.”

“Yes. Got it. Thank you. Interesting work, was it?”

Kron shrugged. “It paid the bills.”

“What is your age?”

“Kron is older than your solar system but younger than the universe. I have lost track of the years, which are as inconsequential as the fleeting stars. Six billion, perhaps? Give or take a few hundred million.”

“Um, okay, I’ll put down ’60.’ That seems close enough for our purposes. And I understand that you wish to apply for a job as a greeter at one of Crappie-Mart’s 3,500 food and fishing supply outlets?”

“Yes. The one downtown, here in your Earth city of Poughkeepsie.”

“Why?”

“Why what?”

“Why are you applying for this position, Al?”

“It’s embarrassing.” Kron looked away.

“Tut, tut, Al. Just tell me. I need to put something down on my form.”

Kron coughed. “Ah, well, I may have accidentally destroyed my home planet by mistake. Unfortunately, my island lair and all my universal possessions were on it. Not to mention six million or so of my fellow Grocks. The Grocks who happened to be off-planet at the time were very upset with me. Since then, I cannot bring myself to destroy another world. Therefore I need money and a place to live.”

“Ah. I’ll put down ‘retired,’ then.”

“That is accurate,” said Kron.

“Now, Al…”

“Call me Kron.”

“Very well, Kron. Let me ask some hypothetical questions. What would you say when a new customer enters the store?”

“I would say: Welcome to Crappie-Mart, home of edible plants and tasty skinned animals, as well as a splendid selection of equipment you may use to capture and kill defenseless aquatic creatures. Behave respectfully while you shop, or I shall introduce you to my thunder-club.”

To emphasize this last statement, he lightly tapped his club on the floor. The building shook. Pictures fell off the walls.

Mr. Dingle made a note. “Welcome to Crappie-Mart. Yes, excellent. And what would you do if you noticed a customer was shoplifting?”

“I would use my trustworthy thunder-club to pulverize the worthless being until his or her blood filled the floor and his or her bones were dust.”

Kron paused for a second.

“Then I would obtain a mop and clean up the mess.”

He sat back, satisfied.

Mr. Dingle just stared for a moment. Finally, he said, “Um, yes, I’m sure that would be the first impulse of most of our greeters, but the _correct_ answer is that you would alert the store manager, who would call the police.”

Kron frowned. “That seems most inefficient.”

“Yes, I understand. But can you bring yourself to do it? Instead of… Instead of what you just said?”

“If that is your wish. It is your store, after all.”

“Excellent. Excellent.” Mr. Dingle made a note. “Now, what if a woman nearby was having a medical emergency? A heart attack, for example?”

Kron thought hard, wanting to get this one right.

“I would lay my hand upon her chest and use my healing powers to repair her anatomy. Then I would ask her not to do that again, as it might upset the other customers.”

“Um, you have healing powers? Are you certified, by any chance?”

Kron beamed. “I am a Class 1 Galaxial Lifeforce Provider. I completed my training on the planet Preposteron in the Proxima Hyperbole system when their primary star was still a cloud of swirling dust.” Then he slumped a little. “Although to be completely honest I haven’t used my life-giving skills in several eons. My previous employment tended to focus in the other direction.”

“Ah, so you are a First Responder! Outstanding! One last question, Kron. When can you start?”

“I am free tomorrow.”

“Excellent. Well, Mr. Kron, you’re hired. My assistant will guide you through the necessary paperwork.” Mr. Dingle stood and extended his hand.

Kron rose from his chair and said, “I do not clasp appendages of lesser beings.”

“Ah, yes. Of course. Risk of coronavirus. Silly of me.” He pushed the intercom button. “Miss Gibbons, we are extending an offer of employment to Mr. Kron. Would you be so kind as to help him with the paperwork?”

Miss Gibbons entered the office and directed Kron to an adjacent conference room. As she turned to leave, she whispered, “So it went well, then?”

“Best candidate I’ve seen all week,” said Mr. Dingle.
