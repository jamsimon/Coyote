Raindrops dive-bombed the black and white car on the side of the road, generating a hellish cacophony. Oblivious to the noise, Frank admired himself in the rearview mirror and noted how well the uniform fitted his slender but muscular frame. Traffic on the highway was light to virtually nonexistent, as usual for this time of night. A solitary car passed him slowly, probably suspicious that the police were using that newfangled radar gun to catch speeders. But Frank was doing no such thing, and the Nevada police didn’t even have the radar equipment yet.

Frank tilted the mirror down to get a better look at the uniform. His nameplate read “HTUOMYAW” in the mirror. _Damn_, he thought as he stared at his reflection, _Officer Frank Waymouth, you are a handsome devil._ Frank combed his hair and placed the peaked cap on his head. Then he readjusted the mirror, checked for traffic, signaled, and pulled the Buick Century police cruiser carefully out onto the road.

Thirty years from now, Nevada’s Highway 50 would be named “The Loneliest Road in America” by Life magazine. But in 1956, “godforsaken” might have been a more apt descriptor. At night, you could drive for hours without seeing the lights of another car - and you’d better carry some extra gas in the trunk in case you didn’t make it to the next filling station. The solitude suited Frank, who was hoping for a quiet evening’s drive. He set off in the direction of the California state line.

His lights illuminated the first of many small signposts along the side of the highway, placed there by a Minnesota shaving cream company.

“NO MATTER,” read the first sign.

“HOW YOU SLICE IT,” said the second, a few yards later.

“IT’S STILL YOUR FACE”

“BE HUMANE”

“USE”

“**_BURMA SHAVE_**,” proclaimed the last.

Frank drove on. There’d be no more of these signs for at least a few miles.

The radio suddenly came to life. “Attention all units. Two convicts have escaped from Ely Prison. They are dangerous and should be approached with caution. We believe they may have acquired civilian clothes. They may or may not be traveling together, and are likely heading for Highway 50 or 93.”

_Damn_, thought Frank. _There goes my peaceful evening_.

\**********************************************************************************

Roger Burnbaum rubbed his eyes and tried not to let the monotonous sound of the windshield wipers put him to sleep. He rolled the window down a crack. It let in some rain but the breeze would help keep him awake. He tried the radio again but he was too far afield to get a good signal. The only welcome distractions were the occasional Burma Shave signs.

“WHEN DRIVING”

“IN THE RAIN”

“SLOW IT DOWN”

“OR FEEL THE PAIN.”

“USE SOOTHING”

“**_BURMA SHAVE_**”

His head nodded and quickly popped back up. _Damn._ _If this keeps up I’ll have to pull over for the night, even if it means missing the sales meeting in Reno. The boss will have a fit, but that’ll still be better than running off the road in the middle of nowhere … WHAT THE …? God Damn It!_

Roger slammed on the brakes and swerved to avoid hitting the guy standing on the side of the road with his thumb out. _Who the hell would be out trying to hitchhike in this rain, at this time of night?_

He was on the verge of driving away when he felt a surge of pity for the man. He brought the car to a stop and leaned over to open the passenger door just as the man ran up. The hitchhiker got in. He was drenched to the bone and had a couple of days’ stubble on his face, but he seemed reasonably clean.

“Much obliged, Sir, I really appreciate it. It’s a hell of a night out there. The name’s Jim. Jim Smith. Pleased to meet you.” He offered his hand.

Roger shook it. “Roger Burnbaum. Happy to help. I’m heading to Reno.”

“That would be perfect for me, if you don’t mind the company. Thank you kindly.”

“There’s a towel in the back seat. I keep one handy in weather like this. You can wipe yourself down. I’ll turn up the heat.”

“Much obliged, Sir.”

“Call me Roger.”

“OK, Roger.” He flashed a smile.

“Truth is, Jim, I got a selfish reason for picking you up. You can help keep me awake. I was dozing off before, and I can’t afford the time to pull over.”

“Well, now, Roger, if you want I’d be happy to drive a spell.”

Roger felt a brief shiver and wondered if he’d made the right choice by allowing this man into his car. “No, that’s fine, Jim. I’ll be all right with a little conversation.”

They both stared out the window as some more signs appeared.

“DON’T STOP”

“FOR HITCHERS”

“AND BE THEIR”

“CHAUFFEUR”

“WE’D HATE TO LOSE”

“A CUSTOMER”

“**_BURMA SHAVE_**”

Jim chuckled. “Well, well, well. I’m sure glad I wasn’t standin’ on the other side of them signs when you drove up.”

Roger forced a laugh and said, “Aw, that wouldn’t have made any difference to me. Like you said, it’s a hell of a night. What’s your line of work, Jim?”

Jim finished using the towel and tossed it into the back seat. “Well, I guess I’m what you’d call a jack-of-all-trades. I do a little of this, a little of that. You know how it is.”

“Yes. Yes, I do.” He didn’t.

“And yourself, Roger? What do you do?”

“I’m in sales. I’m on the road a lot. Have you been shopping for a new swimming pool, by any chance? We’ve got some nifty above-ground models. I got some brochures you can look at in the trunk.”

“Ha, ha. No. Got no use for a pool, I’m afraid. I live on the road.”

“Do you, Jim? But you’ve got no bags with you.”

“Yeah, I know. There’s a story behind that, and I’ll tell it to you sometime later, maybe. Meantimes, I was wonderin’ - does this radio of yourn work?”

“It works fine, but it’s hard as hell to get any reception out here. You’re welcome to try.”

Jim turns the knob and gets mostly static.

“Pfffzzz … crackle … sssss … news on the hour … pffzz … two escaped convicts … pffzz … Ely, Nevad … pffzt … dangerous and … szzztch … do not … schfffftpz …”

Jim switched it off. “You’re right, Roger. No reception way out here. Nothin’ out here but us.”

They drove on in silence for a few miles. Roger wasn’t sleepy anymore.

\************************************************************************************

Officer Frank Waymouth drove the cruiser cautiously down the highway, not wanting to have any unfortunate accidents in the pounding rain. _It’s a perfect night for a jail escape_, he thought. _Terrible visibility and the dogs will have trouble picking up any scent in this weather._ He listened to the police radio but so far there were no reports of any sightings.

“DRIVE CAREFULLY”

“AND DON’T LANE HOP”

“CAUSE THE NEXT BEND”

“MIGHT HIDE A COP”

“USE”

“**_BURMA SHAVE_**”

Frank chuckled. He had to hand it to those Burma Shave advertising guys. They really had a great sense of humor.

The radio broke the silence. “Attention all units. We have a report of a naked body lying in the drainage ditch on the north side of Highway 50, about ten miles east of Eureka. Who can respond? Over.”

Another policeman closer to the location answered the call. “Car 71 here. I am on route. Ten minutes away. Over.”

_Damn_, thought Frank. _This is getting serious. I need to step up my game. Time for a change of strategy._

Frank stepped on the gas and resolved to pull over the next vehicle he saw.

\************************************************************************************

Roger was gripping the wheel harder, and his fingers were turning white. He couldn’t stop thinking about the little “insurance policy” he had stashed in the glove compartment. He might be able to reach over and grab it if the guy would just fall asleep. But there seemed to be no chance of that. Jim was wide awake and appraised him curiously.

“You sure you don’t want me to drive apiece?” Jim asked.

“No, I’m good, thanks.”

Roger wasn’t sure whether he could take this guy one-on-one in a fair fight. More importantly, he didn’t know if Jim had any kind of a weapon on him.

_Even if he’s one of the escaped convicts they mentioned on the radio, he might not be armed,_ Roger figured_. Then again, he’s not in prison garb. He must have gotten his street clothes somewhere. Who’s to say he didn’t pick up a knife as well? It’s probably safest to keep driving until we reach some kind of civilization. But what then?_

“Penny for your thoughts,” Jim said.

“Oh, just wondering how much further it is to Reno. Haven’t seen a signpost in a while.”

“Yeah, except for Burma Shave. They must have spent a ton of money planting those things all around the country. Look, here’s another one.”

“DON’T TRY TO PASS”

“THAT SPEEDING CAR”

“GET YOUR CLOSE SHAVES”

“FROM THE HALF-POUND JAR”

“OF”

“**_BURMA SHAVE_**”

Jim chuckled. “Yeah, that’s pretty darn good, don’tcha think, Roger? Hey, you happen to have any gum on you?”

Roger muttered, “Gum? No. I don’t think so…”

Jim reached forward. “Maybe in your glove compartment?”

“NO!” Roger yelled. But it was too late.

“What the hell are you yellin’ for? I only… Well, lookie here. What’s this?” Jim reached into the glove box and pulled out a handgun. He looked it over, whistling. “Well, I’ll be. If that don’t beat all. What do you got one of these for?”

Jim put his finger in the trigger and smiled at Roger.

It was all Roger could do to stay on the road. He slowed down. And then he noticed the flashing lights coming up fast behind him.

Jim looked back. “Well, well, well. I guess you musta been speeding, my man. Let’s just put this little beauty back in the glove box, shall we, and be careful what we say. The cops get very antsy about weapons. I won’t mention the gun if you don’t. I’d hate to have to shoot it out.” Jim winked.

The car rolled to a stop and Roger turned it off. He watched in the side mirror as the police officer got out of his vehicle and approached. Roger rolled the window down, saying a silent prayer.

\************************************************************************************

The rain had slowed considerably. Frank got out of the cruiser and walked toward the driver’s door. He bent down to look inside.

“Good evening, gentlemen.”

Frank noticed that the driver had a strange expression on his face. He seemed more nervous than a routine traffic stop should warrant.

“Would you mind stepping out of the car, Sir?” Frank asked the driver. Then he pointed to the passenger. “And you, Sir, are to remain inside the vehicle, please.”

The driver got out of the car. _Strange_, thought Frank. _He hasn’t even asked me why I pulled him over._

“Would you please walk back here with me, Sir? That’s right. Now please put your hands on the trunk and lean forward for me. Just like that. Thank you.”

While Frank patted him down, the driver was muttering something. Frank leaned forward and asked, “What did you say, Sir?”

“A gun,” the man whispered. “The other guy has a gun. He hitched a ride. I think he’s one of those convicts.”

Frank quickly straightened up and unholstered his weapon. He said quietly, “You stay right here and don’t move a muscle, you understand?”

Frank walked toward the passenger door with his gun drawn.

“Sir? I need you to get out of the vehicle very slowly, making no sudden moves. Am I clear? Ok, do it now.”

The door opened and the passenger got out saying, “Officer? What seems to be the problem?”

“Hands on your head. Now. Take five steps away from the car, and turn around slowly. Keep your hands on your head. Now kneel down.”

The man said, “I don’t understand…”

Frank shouted, “I said don’t move!” and shot him in the forehead. The body formerly known as Jim fell backward into the drainage ditch.

Roger had been watching and exclaimed, “You shot him! But he didn’t reach for the gun! I think it’s still in the car!”

And then Roger noticed the officer’s gun, which was pointed directly at him.

“Please calm down, Sir,” Frank said. “He was reaching for a weapon. Everything will be fine if you do as I say. Keep your hands on the vehicle.”

“Was that man the escaped convict?” Roger asked.

“Him? No. Never saw him before in my life.”

“Then why…”

“Quiet now, Sir. Listen closely. I need you to get into the back seat of the car and strip down to your underwear. You can keep your socks on. Everything else comes off. Leave the clothes in the car. They’re evidence. Now hand me your wallet and keys.”

Roger handed over the items. “Please, I …”

“Shush now, Mister … Burnbaum, is it?” Frank was looking at the man’s driver’s license.

“Yes.”

“Get in the car and do as I say. It’s perfectly fine, Mr. Burnbaum.”

Roger got in while Frank stood at the open door with the gun and watched him undress. When he was done, Frank said, “Now would you mind slipping your shoes back on and getting out for a moment? This will only take a sec. I appreciate your patience.”

Roger was getting angry. He got out and looked at the nameplate on the officer’s shirt.

“Look, Officer Waymouth, I …”

“My name ain’t Waymouth,” Frank interrupted. He shot Roger point blank in the right temple. Blood splattered onto Frank’s face and uniform. The body dropped heavily to the ground and Frank kicked it into the ditch.

Frank dove into the back seat and rapidly changed into Roger’s clothes, wiping his face clean with the towel. He exited and threw the towel and uniform into the ditch, keeping the gun. Then he patted down Jim’s body, pocketed his wallet, and walked calmly back to the patrol car to turn off the flashers.

Frank closed the cruiser door and sauntered back to Roger’s car. He jumped behind the wheel and turned the key in the ignition. The whole process took less than three minutes from the time of the shooting.

_I really enjoyed being a policeman tonight_, Frank thought. _But there’s no way I could keep driving the cruiser, now that they found the real cop’s body out by Eureka_.

Frank admired himself in the rearview mirror and noted how Roger’s clothes looked a little baggy on him. But they’d do well enough for now. _Damn_, he thought as he stared at his reflection, _Mr. Roger Burnbaum, you are a handsome devil._ The new Roger combed his hair. Then he readjusted the mirror, checked for traffic, signaled, and pulled the Chrysler Imperial carefully out onto the road. He kept within the speed limit the entire way to Reno. It generally pays to obey the law.

As Frank approached the Reno city limits, he noticed a set of signs.

“DO YOUR WHISKERS”

“MISBEHAVE”

“GRUNT AND GRUMBLE”

“RANT AND RAVE?”

“SHOOT THE BRUTES WITH”

“**_BURMA SHAVE_**”
