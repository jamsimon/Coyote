The room smelled of disinfectant, sweat, and sickness. It was a warm Friday in Houston and the hospital air conditioning either needed maintenance or else some soulless administrator had set the temperature too high to save money. Robert Morticallo breathed in and out as the respirator operated. He hadn’t opened his eyes since the accident.

_He shouldn’t even have been driving at the age of 92_, thought his son William. _What was he thinking? Now we’re paying $3,000 a day to keep him alive. Would he even want that?_

William glanced over at his sister Ruth and her husband Tom. Ruth looked tired. She’d been spending too much time here over the past several days. Tom was sipping a cup of coffee and appeared to be somewhat bored.

The doctor walked in and examined Robert for a few minutes, then approached the family. “Well,” he said, “there’s been no change since yesterday. Robert’s brain function has ceased. The machines are the only reason he is still breathing. There’s nothing more we can do. Unlike a coma, from which a patient can sometimes awaken, there is no coming back from brain death. I’m very sorry. At this point, it is up to you as the holders of his medical proxy to decide when to turn off the machines and let him go.”

William grabbed Ruth’s hand and his eyes asked her the question. She nodded, then turned away.

“Turn it off,” said William quietly. “It’s time.”

The doctor walked over to the machine and switched it off.

“How long will it take?” William asked.

“It should be almost immediate,” said the doctor.

“Shouldn’t he have stopped breathing?” asked Ruth.

With an expression of surprise, the doctor swung around and placed his stethoscope against Robert’s chest.

“This … isn’t … possible,” he stammered.

Robert opened his eyes and said, “What happened? Where’s my goddamn car, and what the hell are all of you standing around _here_ for?”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One being who certainly _wasn’t_ standing there was me. At the moment of the fortunate Mr. Morticalo’s recovery, I was relaxing on Lido beach, about 850 miles to the East. The regular crash of the waves upon the shore was quite soothing. I had left my robe in my hotel room and was enjoying the sun’s rays upon my body. The hotel’s reclining beach chair was very comfortable and there was a gentle, refreshing breeze coming in from the gulf. Life was good, I thought. I drained the remains of my piña colada and thought of that song, “Escape,” by Rupert Holmes. I smiled and signaled to the Cabana Boy for a refill.

He walked over a few minutes later with a fresh glass on a tray. “I’ll put this on your tab, Mr. Azrael. Enjoy.”

“Add five bucks for yourself, Ramon,” I said.

“Thank you very much, Sir.” He turned and walked back to the cabana, taking the empty glass with him. I could tell he was starting to wonder about my ability to drink multiple alcoholic beverages without displaying any ill effects, and I resolved to slow my consumption rate. But these things were so darn tasty!

A mother and her six-year-old son walked by my chair.

“Mommy, I want to swim in the ocean!”

“I told you before, Johnny, we can’t go in. The red tide is here now. The water is filled with tiny little creatures that would make you sick. So you’re going to have to swim in the pool, sweetheart.”

“I don’t want the pool! I want the ocean!” He stamped his little feet in the sand.

I sat up and waved my hand toward the gulf. Billions of algae suddenly decided that being alive wasn’t something they particularly wanted to do anymore. The water slowly lost its reddish hue as the deceased algae were pulled out to sea by the waves.

I smiled at the mother. “It’s okay now. You can take him in the water.”

She looked a little confused for a moment, then she said to her son, “It’s okay, Johnny. The creatures went away. We can swim in the gulf now.” They walked to the water, laughing.

I drained my drink and waved to Ramon. What the hell, I thought. It’s a vacation, after all.

I love Florida.

On the other side of the Atlantic, Ian Wilson’s black cab swung into the driveway just off of Kensington Gardens near the High Street and the driver whistled. _Posh neighborhood_, he thought. _Very posh. This rider should stand me a nice tip, then. Unless he’s a bloody git._

A man was standing at the side of the road with a suitcase and a carry-on bag. “Tha’s wha’ I’m talkin’ abou’!” said Ian to himself. “It’s an airport run, innit?” He came to a stop and rolled down his window. “Good day, Sir. Where to, Guv?”

“Heathrow,” said the man. “And I’m running late. There’s an extra fifty quid in it if you can get me there in twenty minutes.” He opened the passenger door, threw his bags inside, and got in.

The cabbie pulled onto Kensington High Street. “Ah, I’ll try me best, Guv. But traffic can be a bitch this time o’ day.”

“I know. That’s why I’m offering fifty quid.”

Congestion on the High Street made for slow progress. Ian looked at his passenger in the mirror and said, “I’m gonna try to use the back roads to get over to the M4. Hang on, Gov.” He made a sudden left on to Allen Street. “SHITE! WHERE THE BLOODY HELL DID _HE_ COME FROM?”

The cabbie slammed on his brakes, but to no avail. He struck the pedestrian full on. The man launched into the air and was thrown over the cab. Unfortunately, he came down right in front of another car which hit him decisively and sent him flying into the plate glass window of Waterstone’s Bookstore. Glass flew in all directions as the unfortunate victim impacted head first, finally connecting with a bookshelf before his limp body crumpled to the ground.

Ian pulled the cab over to the side of the road and got out, saying, “No, no, no, this can’t be happening.” He met the other driver, who was similarly stunned. They started to discuss what to do. Meanwhile, Ian’s passenger got out with his bags and ran to the High Street to hail another cab.

“Bloody git,” muttered Ian. “He’s a material witness.”

The sound of falling glass came from the bookstore behind them. The two drivers turned to see the victim standing up and carefully brushing glass shards off his jacket. He waved to them. “Hallo? I’m fine, guys. Perfectly fine. I don’t even seem to have any bruising. It’s the oddest thing, innit? Damned lucky, I’d say.”

On Saturday I had reached page 95 of Terry Pratchett’s book, _Mort,_ and couldn’t stop chuckling. What an imagination. Sir Terry was only 66 when he passed away, as I recalled. A shame, really. Ah, well, they all have to meet their maker sometime. Or meet me, at least. I reached for my Mai Tai, debating whether the switch in cocktails had been a good decision. I watched the sunset and noticed three people on horseback approaching along the shoreline. I shaded my eyes. It couldn’t be _them_, could it?

Yes. It could.

I probably should have recognized them sooner, based on the color of the horses. White, black, and red. Maybe the cocktails were starting to affect me after all.

They stopped their horses in front of my beach chair. They declined to dismount.

“You look like death,” said the figure on the red horse.

“Does that surprise you?” I asked.

“No, not particularly. But I do wonder why these humans don’t seem to have caught on. Shouldn’t they be screaming and running away in fear?”

“Oh, they see what I wish them to see. Which at the moment is a balding Jewish man in his mid-50s drinking a piña colada. No, forgive me, a Mai Tai.” I took a sip. “Would you like one? I can call Ramon over.”

“No, thank you,” said War.

Famine raised her hand. “I’d like to try one, please.” War gave her a dirty look.

I waved Ramon over. “How about you, Pestilence?” I asked.

The figure on the white horse said, “Will it be sterilized?”

“Um, no, I don’t believe so.”

“Good. Okay, then. Sure. Why not?”

I looked back at the first figure and coaxed, “Come on now, War. Don’t be stubborn.”

“Yes, yes, alright,” said War. “Just a small one.”

Ramon arrived. “A round of Mai Tais for my friends and me, Ramon. If you please.”

“Of course, Mr. Azrael. On your tab?”

“Indeed. Room 666, as I think you know. Thank you, my boy.”

Ramon walked away. As soon as he had gone, I asked, “Well, comrades, I assume this isn’t a social visit. Has the end of the world come already? If so, I’m very disappointed. I had been planning for another few thousand years, at least. It would’ve been nice to get a little advanced notice. I’ve got some stock market investments that will take a few days to liquidate. I hope I’ll be able to get that done, at least?”

“There’s no need to liquidate anything. The End of Days is still a ways off,” said Famine.

“…as far as we know,” added Pestilence. “The Big Guy plays his cards close to the vest sometimes.”

War jumped off his red steed and said, “Now what’s all this about a work stoppage, Azrael? Are you having problems with management? Because if so, we’d like to know.”

“No, no, nothing like that. I simply wanted a few days off, is all.”

“I see. But I wish you had told us first. Don’t you realize the grief you’ve caused us?”

“Grief? How so?”

“Good God, Man, isn’t it obvious? You can’t have a war without death. It isn’t _done_. It’s not _civilized_. I’ve had to allow truces to be called all around the globe. The newspapers are picking up on it, and they’re wondering where all this peacemaking is coming from. The ceasefires don’t make sense because there‘s no reason to stop the fighting.”

“Well, a ceasefire does prevent unnecessary deaths on both sides of the conflict,” I suggested.

“And when has _that_ ever been a sufficient reason to call a halt to some good old-fashioned bloodshed?” War crossed his arms and turned away in a huff.

“I agree with War,” said Pestilence. “Armed conflict without death is just silly. The same goes for me. What’s the point of creating a world-wide contagion if at least some of the people who are infected don’t die?”

“Yes, and it won’t be long before people realize that starvation no longer has negative consequences,” added Famine.

War turned around. There were tears in his eyes. “Let’s face it, Azrael. Without you, our lives are meaningless. O Death, where is thy sting?”

“Oh, stop it, all of you. You’re being melodramatic,” I said. “Ah, here come the cocktails. Thank you, Ramon. Take another five for yourself.”

Famine and Pestilence got down off their horses and grabbed some beach chairs. Ramon handed them their drinks. War remained standing, but he accepted the glass and took a sip.

“Mmm, quite tasty,” he said.

“Thank you, Sir,” said Ramon. He walked back to the cabana.

“Now, look,” I said. “I’m not quitting my employment. I simply want a long weekend off. Is that so bad? I’ve been doing this job for over 3.7 billion years without a break. Except for the occasional office party. Heh heh. Do you remember the night Lucifer got drunk and brought the comet down upon our heads? What a practical joker.”

“Wasn’t that the one that wiped out the dinosaurs?” asked Pestilence.

“Oh, I remember!” said Famine. “The skies darkened and the plants died out. The herbivores had nothing to eat. And when they starved to death, the carnivores soon followed.”

“Oh yeah. And the few who were left fought each other to the death for the remaining food,” recalled War.

“Good times, good times,” said Famine.

We four comrades stared out at the water, reminiscing.

After a time, War said, “Thank you for the beverage, Azrael. It was surprisingly refreshing.”

“Don’t mention it,” I replied.

“Now will you please GET BACK TO WORK?” asked Famine.

“No. I’m not ready yet,” I said.

“But you’re messing things up for all three of us,” said Pestilence.

“You’re returning to work even if we have to drag you there ourselves!” threatened War.

The three of them got out of their beach chairs and approached me, menacingly.

I raised my hand and commanded, “STOP!” in my iciest tone. They stopped.

“You know my power. I can kill with a word. Or a look. Don’t test our friendship.”

They stepped back. War stammered, “You … you can’t kill _US_! _We are anthropomorphic beings_. We can never die!”

“Who said anything about killing _you_?” I glanced at the horses.

“You wouldn’t,” said Pestilence.

“Wouldn’t I?”

“You couldn’t,” said Famine.

“Yes, I could,” said I. “If I so choose.”

“I think this whole thing has gotten out of hand,” said War. “Why don’t we move along now, and let our dear friend Azrael enjoy the rest of his weekend?” They mounted their horses.

“A wise choice,” I said. “No hard feelings?”

“No, of course not,” said War.

“No harm, no foul,” said Pestilence.

“We just wanted to make sure you were all right,” said Famine.

“I am Death,” I said. “What could possibly happen to me? Fare thee well, fellow horsepersons.”

They spurred their horses and galloped away into the distance.

Ramon stopped by. “We’re closing up for the night, Mr. Azrael. Last call.”

I carefully considered my options and ordered a Tequila Sunset.

After two days with a mortality rate of zero, the humans appeared to be getting the message. It wasn’t universally perceived as good news, however.

“**A World Without Death: Overcrowding and Resource Scarcity Imminent,**” said The New York Times.

“**Churches Empty. Morticians and Clergy Demand A Return to Mortality,**” said The Washington Post.

“**Real Estate Prices Skyrocket,**” said The Wall Street Journal.

“**Where Has All the Toilet Paper Gone?**” said USAToday.

“**The End of the World: What Happens When the Earth Becomes Uninhabitable and We Still Inhabit It?**” said The Economist.

“**Up to Our Necks in Cockroaches? If Bugs Can’t Die Either, We’ve Got Big Problems,**” said Insects Illustrated.

As people adjusted to the thought of not dying, many became bolder. Crime rates increased. Thrill-seekers took bigger risks.

Unfortunately, many people failed to account for the possibility they could still be hurt. Badly. And for the moment, death was no longer a release.

Sunday was another fine day on Lido Beach and I enjoyed the gentle breeze as I sipped my mojito. An anthropomorphic entity could get used to this kind of thing. But after reading this morning’s newspaper I knew I’d have to get back to work very soon. Leave it to the humans to turn immortality into a curse. They were wrong about the bugs, though. I wouldn’t let those things multiply without restraint. I may be the grim reaper, but I’m not a sadist.

The truth is, I don’t spend much of my time dealing with plants, organisms, or animals other than man. I let nature take its course with the lesser living entities. Which is not to say I won’t step in now and again. Like with the red tide the other day. Or Grumpy Cat.

I looked out at the water, which was fairly calm today. A few swimmers and body surfers were enjoying the algae-free waves. And off in the distance was a bearded man walking on top of the water, coming this way. None of the humans paid him any attention. He reached the shoreline and made a beeline for my chair.

“Hello, Boss,” I said, as he arrived. “I wasn’t expecting to see you here in Sarasota.”

God shrugged and said, “I’m everywhere.”

“Of course, you are. Pull up a beach chair. Hey, Ramon!”

Ramon trotted over. He was making pretty decent money this weekend, thanks to yours truly.

“I’d like a Death in the Afternoon,” I said when he arrived. “And put whatever my esteemed friend is having on my tab, including $10 for yourself.”

“I’m afraid I’m not familiar with Death in the Afternoon,” Ramon replied.

I looked at his youthful form. “No, of course you’re not. Not yet, anyway. But the drink was invented by Ernest Hemmingway. A flute of champagne with a jigger of Absinthe.”

“I … I don’t think we have any Absinthe.”

“Yes, you do,” said God. “It’s right behind the gin. Go look again.” God pointed. I knew that even if the Absinthe wasn’t there before, it was there now.

“Um, ok. And you’re having?”

“I’ll take a Three Wise Men,” said God. “Equal parts Johnnie Walker Scotch, Jack Daniels Bourbon, and Jim Beam Whiskey. On the rocks, please.”

“Haha. Three Wise Men. Got it. I’ll be just a few moments.” He trotted to the cabana.

“So what brings you to Florida?” I asked.

“I’m everywhere,” God repeated. “But I did wish to speak with you.”

“About …?”

“This little vacation of yours is causing me a spot of bother, Azrael. The Birth Angels are asking why they can’t have some time off as well. The Tooth Fairies are complaining about working conditions and they’re picketing the Pearly Gates. And Santa’s elves are threatening a work stoppage. That one is particularly vexing to me since they already get 363 days a year off. I told them this was God’s Kingdom, not France, and if they didn’t get in line I’d give their cushy jobs to the Tooth Fairies and solve two problems at once. I never did see the point of collecting baby teeth anyway. I think that was one of Lucifer’s ideas before he fell.”

“I’m sorry about all that. The other three horsemen of the apocalypse aren’t happy with me, either. I suppose I didn’t foresee all of these impacts when I requested some time off.”

“I did,” said God. “I’m all-knowing, you know. But since you’ve been a good, steady worker over the past several eons, I decided to grant your request anyway. I hope you enjoyed your vacation. Now, do you feel sufficiently relaxed to return to work? I’m afraid if you don’t restart soon we’ll become hopelessly backlogged.”

I didn’t respond immediately since Ramon was arriving with the drinks. We took them from the tray and I said, “Thank you, Ramon. And now would you be so kind as to total my cabana bill? I’ll be checking out today. I need to return to work.”

“Yes, Sir. I’ve enjoyed serving you, Mr. Azrael. I hope we’ll meet again soon.”

“You shouldn’t,” I said. “But thank you for the thought.” And I smiled.
