Prince Piglet strutted up and down in his spacious pen to keep warm. It was a blustery fall night in Denmark, Wisconsin and all of the animals on Macbeth’s Family Farm knew winter was coming, despite the fact that none of them owned a pin-up calendar or an iPhone.

Normally, Piglet would be fast asleep in his bed of straw by this time. But tonight he was restless. Something was rotten in the village of Denmark, and it wasn’t just the half-eaten apples that Farmer Odious Macbeth had thrown into his trough. _It has something to do with the wind_, Piglet thought. _It’s whispering_. He couldn’t make out the words, but he could tell the news was bad. And as the son of the recently deceased farm king, Piglet had a duty to protect the farm from whatever evil was coming their way.

The moon disappeared behind some clouds, making it difficult to see. Piglet was about to give up and go back to bed when the faint sound of a tolling bell could be heard coming from the clock in the village mall, several miles away. Piglet counted _… ten … eleven … twelve._ _Midnight. The witching hour._

“Spooky, isn’t it?” said a voice in his right ear.

Piglet jumped and then he recognized the voice. “Charlotta! You scared the bejesus out of me. Don’t sneak up on me like that!”

“I’m sorry, Sire,” replied the tiny black widow spider. “But I’m afraid I can’t make much noise even if I wanted to. I need to be inside your ear before you can hear me at all.”

“Yes, yes, well. And why are you up so late, my friend? Missing your ex-husband, perhaps? It is very strange that he disappeared so soon after your wedding.”

“Yes,” replied the spider wistfully. “I do miss him. Frank was very … nourishing.”

“I am sorry for your loss.” Piglet shivered. “It is indeed spooky this eventide. Ghosts and daemons roam on nights such as these.”

“Surely you don’t believe in such things, My Prince?”

“There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy, Charlotta.”

“My philosophy is ‘eat or be eaten.’ That is the cruel reality of life, Sire.”

“Hold!” commanded Piglet. “But lo! What is yon specter which doth approach?”

Charlotta crawled out of Piglet’s ear to take a look, then scampered back in. “It appears to be an apparition, Sire! Methinks it looks much like your departed father.”

“My King! Father! Royal swine!” Piglet called. “Answer me! It is I, your son, Piglet! Why does your soul walk these trails in the dead of night? Why are you not feasting in Pighalla?”

“Mark me,” commanded the ghost.

“I do, Father. Speak!”

“My soul has no peace. I cannot rest until I am avenged, my son. It falls to you to do this, as I am unarmed now.” To demonstrate the point, the ghost’s appendages turned into mist. The rest of his body floated in mid-air.

“Avenged? Wherefore avenged, noble torso?”

“They lied to you, Piglet. My death was not an accident. I was murdered. Dismembered. Eaten.”

“Heaven help us!” cried Piglet.

Charlotta whispered, “Wow, that’s heavy. But being eaten is a good way to go. Did I ever explain my philosophy of life?”

Ignoring her, Piglet asked the ghost, “Who did this foul deed, Father? Who would dare?”

The shade looked down. “Farmer Odious Macbeth dispatched me. He and his goodwife Gertrude.”

Piglet was aghast. “The _humans_ killed you? How can that be? They are our servants. They care for us. They feed us. They cure our sicknesses. Why would they do such a thing?”

“I have learned that this is what they do, my son. They will do the same to you one day.”

“Do they eat all of the animals on the farm, then?”

“No. They have other uses for most of them. They steal their milk and their eggs. They make some of them work.”

“Oh! Villainy! Treachery!”

“Avenge me, Piglet!”

“I shall, Father. I swear it.”

“Adieu, then. Adieu. Remember me. Remember me.”

The remainder of the ghost slowly dissolved into the air.

“Well, ain’t that a kick in the ass?” said Charlotta.

\************************************************************************************

The following morning, Piglet considered his options.

“To be, or not to be?” he wondered aloud.

Not realizing the question was rhetorical, Charlotte said, “I rather think it is generally better to be, all things considered. Although to be honest, I haven’t personally tried the latter yet. My ex-husband has, but unfortunately we are no longer on speaking terms so I can’t ask him about it. Anyway, have you come up with a plan for your revenge?”

Piglet nodded, which was somewhat ineffective since Charlotta could not see it from her vantage point. “Tell the rest of the farm animals that we shall have a barn meeting tonight. We must enlist their support for our war on the humans. No dogs, of course. They are the humans’ spies and can’t be trusted.”

“Right you are, Sire. And I shall make some placards.” Charlotta scampered down Piglet’s foreleg and ran to make preparations.

_That spider loves to make placards_, Piglet thought.

\*************************************************************************************

Twelve hours later, the animals were assembled in the barn, curious to hear what Prince Piglet had to say. They wondered if he was finally ready to accept the office of farm king, now that the official grieving period for his father had passed. But they were somewhat confused by the placards which had been hung around the barn.

“ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, AND EVEN THE WORST OF THEM ARE MORE EQUAL THAN HUMANS.”

“4 LEGS GOOD, 2 LEGS BAD. (EXCEPT FOR YOU CHICKENS. YOU’RE ALRIGHT.)”

“8 LEGS ARE ACTUALLY THE BEST. NO OFFENSE, JUST SAYING.”

The prince approached the podium, otherwise known as an old bucket turned upside down. The room became quiet. When he judged the moment was right, Prince Piglet began to orate.

“Friends, Denmarkians, Comrades. Lend me your ears! (No, Porky, put the corn down. Don’t take me so literally.) I have terrible news to share. Last night, I encountered the ghost of my father. Charlotta was there, and can vouch for the truth of this.”

They waited several minutes for Charlotta to write “true” in her web.

Upon her completion, the animals expressed their shock, awe, and dismay that the King’s ghost had made an unscheduled visit. There were protocols for such things, after all. Then the meeting continued.

“The king told me he did not die by accident. He was slaughtered and eaten. By the humans.”

The room erupted into chaos. There were brays, whinnies, howls, caws, clucks, bleats, and squeaks. Piglet waited patiently for the noise to abate.

“The king asked me to avenge his death. This I shall do, by myself if necessary. But it would be better if I had your help. I intend to call a vote on the question of whether war should be waged against the farmer and his wife. I open the floor for questions.”

“Do the humans eat mules?” a mule asked.

“Um, not to my knowledge,” replied the prince.

“Or horses?”

“No.”

“Or insects?”

“Definitely not in Wisconsin.”

“Or goats?”

“Not that I’ve heard.”

“Alpacas?”

“I can’t imagine.”

“Cows?”

“Um, I’ll have to get back to you on that one. Not as a rule, anyway, I believe.”

“Or chickens?”

“I’m not sure, but I do know they steal your eggs.”

“It’s not theft, it’s a fair exchange,” said the chicken. “They give us food and shelter and we give them eggs. It’s capitalism at work.”

“I thought we didn’t like capitalism,” commented an alpaca.

“Well, it’s socialism, then. Same thing,” sneered the chicken.

“But they eat pig!” shouted a pig. “We must stand together, Comrades!”

The pigs unanimously assented to this suggestion. The other animals were silent.

“Time for a vote on the motion,” said Prince Piglet. “As usual, we will allow one vote per species. Mr. Mouse, please call the roll.”

“Horses? Do you say yea or nay on the question of war against the humans?”

The horses conferred amongst themselves.

“Neigh,” said their spokeshorse.

“Pigs?”

“Yea!”

“Sheep?”

“Bah! … I mean, Nay.”

“Alpacas?”

“Nay.”

The voting continued. Only the pigs and the spiders voted in favor. The cows abstained.

“I’m afraid the motion has failed, My Prince,” Mr. Mouse reported.

_Well, then, I’ll get no help from them_, Piglet thought. _I’m on my own. To swine own self be true._

To the audience, the prince said, “Be it on your heads. The meeting is adjourned. I order you to keep the proceedings of this night secret, on pain of death. (Or a bath, whichever you fear most.) The humans must not find out.” Piglet left the podium and walked outside, deep in thought.

Meanwhile, four uninvited eyes jumped down gracefully from their perch on the outside windowsill and trotted back unseen to the farmhouse.

\*************************************************************************************

The cock crowed as the sun rose on the horizon. Piglet had not slept that night. Charlotta clambered up his side and spoke in his ear, “Do you have an alternate plan, My Lord?”

“I do. First, I must find out what the farmers know. I will try to get information from my old friends Slurpees and Zoophilia.”

“But … they are dogs, My Lord.”

“I know you don’t like them, but there is no need for slurs.”

“No. I merely state a fact. They are both of the canine persuasion, and as such, they are loyal to the humans. Their father Felonious is Chief Counselor to Farmer Macbeth, for God’s sake!”

“You think I am unaware of this? Felonious will not be a problem. He is twelve years old. A doddering old fool. And, of course, I must be devious if I am to achieve my revenge. The dogs will not learn of my plans. I will put them off any suspicion by feigning madness.”

“A-ha,” exclaimed the spider. “And I know just how I can help you to fool them. When I’m finished, they will think you are a raving lunatic.”

“What will you do?”

“I will post a message on the web,” answered the spider gleefully.

“Thank you, I think …” muttered Piglet as Charlotta scampered back to the barn.

\************************************************************************************

Later that afternoon, Piglet noticed Zoophilia romping about in the field and he called her over. She leapt over the fence in a single bound and landed next to Piglet.

“How fares My Lord Pig today?”

“Ah, hello, my dear Zoophilia. We haven’t spoken much since my father passed away. How are you and your esteemed family?”

“We are well,” she replied. “My dad has been busy tending sheep. It tires him. But he will be receiving some help soon. The farmer recently sent my brother Slurpees off to sheep-herding school.”

“That is well. Your father is too old to do such work. Farmer Macbeth is cruel to use him thus.”

“Do you remember when we were young, dear pig? The games we three would play? ‘Little pig, little pig, let us in’ …”

Piglet smiled. “… ‘Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.’ Yes, I remember.” Then his face clouded again. “But those bright days are long gone. Now there is only darkness.”

“You never answered my first question,” said Zoophilia. “How fares the prince?”

”I am much troubled in my mind. I was wondering what you could tell me about my father’s death. Farmer Macbeth said it was an accident. What kind of accident, exactly?”

Zoophilia regarded her old friend with a sad expression. “I … I really can’t say.” She stared off into the field.

“You can’t say, or you won’t? Who are you protecting, Zoophilia? Look me in the eye and tell me you know nothing about it!”

Zoophilia continued to stare at the horizon. “Oh, Piglet, why can’t you just enjoy your life? Your father is gone, and nothing can bring him back.”

“I saw his ghost two nights ago,” said Piglet. “He spoke to me.”

Zoophilia regarded him with concern. “You saw? … No. It was a hallucination, Piglet. You are unwell. Perhaps I should ask the farmers to send for the vet.”

“I … AM … NOT … CRAZY,” exclaimed Piglet. And he threw himself down and rolled in the mud. Zoophilia stepped back to avoid being splattered. Then she noticed the brand new spider web on the barn door. It contained a message.

“MAD PIG!” read the cobweb.

Zoophilia regarded the wallowing pig and ran barking back to the farmhouse. Piglet stopped mudding and smiled. He waved a thankful hoof toward Charlotta’s web.

\************************************************************************************

Farmer Odious Macbeth finished locking the sheep in their pen for the night and looked down at Felonious. “That’ll do, Dog,” he said. “That’ll do.” Felonious barked a quick acknowledgment and walked slowly back to the house. He appeared to have a slight limp.

_He’s been a good dog these many years_, the farmer thought. _It will be a real shame to put him down. I’ll have to do it soon, though. As soon as his son gets home._ He quickly caught up with the aging Border Collie.

“I’m worried about Piglet,” the man began.

“Ah, Piglet, yes,” sighed Felonious. “Zoophilia told me about her meeting with him this afternoon. He is apparently quite troubled. Even mad, some say. The death of his father has deranged the poor lad.”

_That’s not what the cats told me last night_, Macbeth thought. _That secret barnyard meeting was the last straw. The pig must die. But I can’t act too hastily. He IS royalty, and it’s been too soon since his father’s death. Plus, I need to find out whose help he has enlisted. For that I need spies._

“Zoophilia is very close to Piglet, isn’t she?” the farmer asked.

“Oh, indeed. She and Slurpees grew up with Piglet. They are all great friends.”

“I understand that Piglet is spreading a rumor that I was responsible for his father’s death.”

Felonious stopped and tilted his head. “But … you _were_ responsible for his death. I watched you slaughter him, Master.”

_Saints preserve us from dumb animals_, Macbeth thought. “Yes, but the rest of the animals aren’t supposed to _know_ that, Felonious. We must keep order, after all.”

“Ah, yes, order. Yes.”

“I’d like you to keep an eye on dear Piglet for me, my friend. I must discover whether he is truly mad, or just faking it. If he is mad, we shall have to get the vet out to examine him. I must also know who he talks with, and how frequently. May I count on you?”

“Of course, of course. I am here to serve, as always.”

They walked on. Macbeth sincerely hoped that Slurpees would prove to be as stupid and pliable as his father had been.

\*********************************************************************************

Piglet slept fitfully that night, which was a vast improvement over no sleep at all. He was awoken by the cockcrow to find two cats watching him with steady eyes.

“Good morning, Prince Piglet, my good friend. You must remember me. I am Rosencatz,” the first cat said.

“And I am Geldertom,” the second cat added.

The prince responded groggily, “I don’t understand why you two need to introduce yourselves every time we meet. I’ve known you for all of your eighteen lives, Rosencatz and Geldertom.”

Another voice in Piglet’s right ear whispered, “Don’t trust them, My Prince. They are spies.”

“Do you think I don’t know that?” Piglet answered.

Charlotta was silent, but Rosencatz said, “No, Prince. We are aware that you know our names. We just enjoy saying them.”

“And to what do I owe this visit?”

“We wanted to see if you were all right,” said Geldertom.

“I wanted to warn you about them,” said Charlotta, simultaneously.

“I wasn’t talking to you,” replied the prince.

The cats looked at one another. Then Rosencatz said, “We wanted to see if you were all right.”

“Someone told us you had gone mad,” added Geldertom. “If it’s ok for me to speak now, that is.”

Charlotta whispered, “Don’t talk to me. They can’t hear me and they don’t know I’m in your ear.”

“Okay,” Piglet acknowledged.

“So are you?” asked Rosencatz.

“… mad?” finished Geldertom.

Prince Piglet stood up. “Why would I be mad? What have you done that would make me angry?”

“Not _angry_ mad…” said Geldertom.

“…_crazy_ mad,” added Rosencatz.

The two cats got up and paced back and forth in front of Piglet while providing further clarification.

“Absurd,” said Rosencatz as he paced to the left.

“Delirious,” said Geldertom as he paced right.

“Demented,” said Rosencatz as he walked to the right.

“Kooky,” said Geldertom as he walked left.

To save paper, we shall consolidate their next comments instead of giving them a full line apiece. The bold text was spoken by **Rosencatz** and the normal text was uttered by Geldertom.

**“Nutty,”** “Psychotic,” **“Aberrant,”** “Bananas,” **“Batty,”** “Crazed,” **“Cuckoo,”** “Deranged,” **“Illogical,”** “Imprudent,” **“Irrational,”** “Loony-toons,” **“Lunatic,”** “Non compos mentis,” **“Nonsensical,”** “Of unsound mind,” **“Off one's rocker,”** “Out of one's mind,” **“Preposterous,”** “Rabid,” **“Raving,”** “Senseless,” **“Unbalanced,”** “Unhinged,” **“Unsound,”** “Unstable,” **“Wacky,”**…

“GOOD GOD, MAKE THEM STOP!” Charlotta yelled into Piglet’s ear.

“ENOUGH!” cried Piglet.

“Insane,” finished Geldertom.

“Was that clear?” asked Rosencatz.

Piglet sighed. “Non compos mentis? Really?”

“It’s a thing,” said Geldertom.

“To answer your question, I am not mad,” stated the prince, definitively. “Am I, Father?”

The cats looked at one another, then back at Piglet.

“Did you say something about your father?” Rosencatz asked.

“I just asked him to confirm that I was not mad. He agreed with me. Didn’t you hear him?”

“Your father is dead,” said Geldertom. “Deceased. Lifeless. Expired. Cadaverous. Departed. Pushing up the daisies…”

“Stop!” commanded Piglet. “I know he’s dead, just as surely as I know that his ghost stands right behind you.”

Both cats suddenly jumped straight up into the air. Unfortunately, their directions were not parallel and they crashed into each other mid-flight, landing together in a jumbled ball of fur. They disentangled themselves.

“Don’t DO that!” yelled Geldertom.

“There’s nothing even there!” added Rosencatz.

“Of course he’s there! He just told me not to trust you.”

“But you _can_ trust us, My Pig …” said Rosencatz.

“… with your very life,” finished Geldertom.

“Or your catnip,” added Rosencatz. “Do you happen to have any catnip that we can keep safe for you, My Lord?” Both cats sat back and looked up hopefully.

Charlotta whispered, “Let us finish this, Sire. Send them back to the house thinking thou be mad.”

“What’s that, Father? You say I should dance for them? Well, then, cats. Watch me dance.”

Piglet jumped around and contorted himself, squealing in the most awful fashion. The cats had to leap out of the way several times to avoid being trod upon. When the prince finished, he said, “Go now, my friends, and tell the farmers that my father sends his highest regards and wishes them wealth, happiness and a long, long life. Be off with you!”

Piglet charged the cats and they retreated, dashing back to the farmhouse.

\************************************************************************************

Felonious summoned his daughter to his side.

“My dear Zoophilia,” the old dog began, “I should like to see the evidence of the young prince’s madness for myself. Let us go to the barn. I shall hide in the hay while you speak with Piglet. If he be mad, I shall convince the master to send for the veterinarian.”

Zoophilia did as her father asked. They proceeded to the barn. When Felonious had hidden himself in the hay, she called for Piglet, who was taking the sun outside.

\************************************************************************************

Piglet entered, but he was not alone.

“Be watchful, My Lord. Spies are everywhere,” advised Charlotta.

“How fares My Lord Pig today?” asked Zoophilia.

“Hopefully, worse than one would think yet better than can be expected.”

“My Lord?”

“I am murderously well, My Lady.”

“That’s … good. I think. And there have been no further sightings of your father?”

“My father is dead,” said Piglet.

“Yes. That is true,” agreed Zoophilia, much relieved.

“And you know how he died, Zoophilia. Tell me.”

“I do not know, My Lord! I was not there. I swear it, upon my bitchhood!”

Charlotta chimed in. “The lady doth protest too much, methinks.”

Piglet shouted, “Females are treacherous! Swear it on malehood, instead!”

“I … I don’t know what to say, My Lord.”

“Say only the truth! Is that beyond thee?”

“I … I … don’t …”

“MY FATHER WAS EATEN AND YOU KNOW THIS! YOU LIE FOR THE FARMERS! FALSE FRIEND!”

Piglet approached Zoophilia menacingly. There was fire in his eyes.

Zoophilia backed up. “You’re scaring me, Piglet! I … I need to pee.”

Piglet began pacing back and forth in front of Zoophilia, chanting crazily. “To pee, or not to pee, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the silent pains of holding one’s bladder, or to let fly a sea of troubles and by releasing them, relieve oneself. To pee, to stream – to stream, perchance to fart - ay, there’s the nub.”

“Stop, Piglet! You’re acting crazy! Oh, I really need to go now!”

“Well, do not do’t in the barn, bitch. Off with you! Get thee to a shrubbery!”

Whimpering, Zoophilia ran out of the barn.

Piglet noticed some movement in the hay. “What, ho! A spy! Could it be my enemy, the farmer? Destroyer of pigs? Eater of souls? Take this, then, villain, and die!”

The angry prince lowered his head and charged the hay at full speed. Charlotta wisely jumped out of his ear just before impact. The top of Piglet’s skull connected with the cowering body of Felonious, who cried, “O, I am slain!” He tried to stand, but collapsed and died on the spot.

“Felonious?” Piglet started. He nudged the body. It did not move.

Charlotta crawled back up into the pig’s ear. “What hast thou done, Piglet?”

Piglet recovered. “I thought it was the farmer. But I do not regret his death. Felonious was a spy. Not only that, he knew of Macbeth’s crime and said nothing. I mourn him not.”

“He wasn’t a bad animal, Piglet.”

“The evil that dogs do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones. So shall it be with Felonious.”

Charlotte dropped out of the pig’s ear as the prince turned and left the barn. Hearing a noise, she looked up to see Rosencatz and Geldertom jumping down from the barn windowsill. _This is getting out of hand_, she thought. _I wonder how Zoophilia and Slurpees will react to the death of their father._

\***********************************************************************************

The answer was not long in coming. The next day, Slurpees returned from sheep-herding school upon hearing of his father’s death. He angrily sought out Farmer Macbeth for an explanation. He bounded the porch steps and entered the house. He found Macbeth and his wife in the kitchen with the two cats.

“O thou vile master,” growled Slurpees, “Where is my father? Present him to me.”

Odious Macbeth had never seen Slurpees in such a state. He stepped back a few paces in fear. “Your father is dead, Slurpees. But not by my hand, I assure you!”

“Dead? How came he dead? Speak, man.”

“It was your friend Piglet. He killed your father in his madness.”

“Piglet? No. He couldn’t have. I would believe you capable of such evil, you scoundrel. But not he. Tell me the truth!” Slurpees began frothing at the mouth and he took two steps toward the farmer.

“The cats saw it! Tell him, cats!” Macbeth screamed.

Rosencatz and Geldertom reluctantly stepped forward.

“I am Rosencatz,” said Rosencatz.

“And I am Geldertom,” said Geldertom.

“I know who you are! What did you see?”

“We sat in the barn window …” began Geldertom.

“… and we saw the whole thing,” finished Rosencatz.

“Piglet and Zoophilia were arguing,” explained thing one.

“It had something to do with pee,” added thing two, helpfully.

“Zoophilia ran out of the barn crying,” said thing one with a smug expression.

“But your father had been hiding in the hay. He moved …”

“… and Piglet saw it.”

“Piglet rushed him without thinking.”

“It was a resounding head-butt.”

“Your father said ‘O! I am slain!’…”

“… and he collapsed.”

“Dead.”

The two cats got up and paced back and forth in front of Slurpees while providing further clarification. They didn’t want to be misunderstood on this critical point of fact.

“Deceased,” said Rosencatz as he paced to the left.

“Inanimate,” said Geldertom as he paced right.

“Departed,” said Rosencatz as he walked to the right.

“Bereft of life,” said Geldertom as he walked left.

**“Defunct,”** “Expired,” **“Gone to meet his maker,”** “Offed,” **“Pushing up…”**

Rosencatz never got to complete his thought, because Slurpees lunged, catching the cat between his jaws and biting down. Geldertom was too shocked by the dog’s sudden movement to react, and before he knew it he had been knocked hard against the wall by a heavy paw. He saw the dog’s jaws approach, and then all went black.

Odious and Gertrude watched in horror. The dog raised its head and looked at them, blood dripping from its jaws. “And where is my sister?” he growled.

Gertrude swallowed. “She was found this morning in the pond, Slurpees. I am truly sorry for your loss.”

“What? Zoophilia went swimming after Father died?”

“No. Your sister is drown’d, drown’d,” said Gertrude. She clenched her eyes shut and raised her arms to defend herself against a blow, but none came. When she dared to open them again after multitudinous seconds, the room was empty except for the corpses of two cats.

\************************************************************************************

Odious knew that Slurpees was dangerous, but he needed him to help destroy Piglet. He couldn’t personally kill the pig in view of the other animals, and the prince’s sudden disappearance would raise questions, particularly since Piglet had told them that the farmers had killed the pig-king. There could be a revolt if the animals begin to fear for their lives. In his current state, Slurpees was Macbeth’s best instrument to defeat the treacherous swine. He chased after the dog.

“Slurpees! Heel! I mean, please return! I have a plan!”

Slurpees stopped and looked back suspiciously at Farmer Macbeth.

“You can have your revenge on the bastard pig that killed your father.”

Slurpees looked curious.

“I have poison,” the farmer grinned.

\*************************************************************************************

Charlotta said, “I have bad news, much worse news, and terrible news.”

“Tell me,” croaked the prince.

“Rosencatz and Geldertom are dead.”

“I assume that was only the bad news,” said the prince. “And it doesn’t sound too bad, to be perfectly honest. They were spies, after all. How did they die?”

“That is the much worse news. They died in Slurpees’ jaws. They were telling him about how you killed his father. They provided one too many synonyms for the word ‘dead,’ I’m afraid.”

“Yes. That would do it,” Piglet agreed.

“Still, they were only the messengers, and they suffered heavily for it. Now, Slurpees will be coming for you. He intends to take your life.”

“How do you know this?”

“The mice, of course. News travels fast on a farm.”

“Surely there cannot be worse news than that?” asked Piglet.

“There is,” said the spider. “Zoophilia is dead. Drown’d.”

“O no. Was it an accident, by someone else’s hand, or by her own?”

“That I cannot say for certain, Sire. But I’m told that her mind snapped after learning of her father’s death. I fear she may have taken her own life.”

“Then I have four deaths on my conscience. Tell me, Charlotta, is it all worth it?”

Charlotta didn’t know. But Piglet’s father did. The ghost appeared in the shadows near the back of the barn.

“Piglet, my son. Do not grieve for these fallen. They all knew of Farmer Macbeth’s crimes, and they did nothing about it. Finish the deed. Stop whining and get on with it.”

“Yes, Father. I will do as you ask. But first I shall visit Zoophilia’s resting place, whether you like it or not. If you want your revenge, be silent and be gone.” The ghost departed.

Piglet and Charlotta walked toward the marshlands, where the bodies of dead farm animals were laid to rest. Having no need of coffins, the animals were buried directly in the dirt, and occasionally some of their bones would resurface. Piglet stopped at one marker and nudged a skull with his snout. He pondered the cranium for some time.

“Alas, poor Lorax! – I knew him, Charlotta. A creature of infinite jest, of most excellent sensibilities. He spoke for the trees. The beautiful Truffula trees. He lived where the Grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it grows. You know the place. He was shortish. And oldish. And brownish. And mossy. And he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy. He told me UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.”

“Ah, yes. Mr. Lorax. Whatever happened to him?”

“He sold the Truffula grove he lived in, and they chopped it down. He bought a beachfront condo in Sarasota with the profits. I guess he wanted to be buried here, though. Huh.” He pushed the skull back down into the mud and wiped his trotters together.

“Anyway, it looks like they laid Zoophilia to rest over there. See that upturned earth? Let’s pay our respects and get back to the barn. We have an appointment with the farmers, and we can’t push it off any further. It’s like my father used to say: If it be now, ’tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now, yet it will come—the readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is it to leave betimes? Let be.”

“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Charlotta.

“I haven’t a clue. But it sounds great, doesn’t it? Let’s go.”

\*************************************************************************************

“Now dip each of your paws in this liquid, Slurpees. Then all you have to do is scratch Piglet and he will soon drop dead from the poison even if he wins the fight. - which I’m sure he wouldn’t,” Odious added hastily.

“I don’t understand why you are helping me in this,” said Slurpees.

“Felonious was my oldest and most trusted advisor. Of course, I wish to help avenge his death.”

“So it has nothing to do with the fact that you fear Piglet’s revenge upon you for the death of his father?”

“I don’t know what you mean,” lied Odious. “Are you ready?”

“Yes. Let’s go.”

\*************************************************************************************

Piglet was waiting in the barn when he heard Slurpees shout from the yard.

“Little pig, little pig, let me in!”

“I’m not playing, Slurpees. I don’t want to fight you.”

“You should have thought of that before you killed my father, evil pig.”

“It was a mistake, Slurpees. I didn’t know it was him hiding in the hay.”

“I don’t care, pig. Come out here and meet your fate like a swine, or show the entire farm what a coward you are.”

Piglet walked outside. The fenced-in area adjacent to the barn was empty except for Slurpees, who was crouching in the far right corner. But every other animal on the farm was watching from the opposite side of the fence. And upon the center wooden gate sat Farmer Macbeth and his wife, just where Piglet had expected them to be.

The pig addressed his opponent. “It’s not me whom you should fight, Slurpees.”

“Isn’t it?”

“No. It is the lying, pig-eating, murderous bastards sitting on the fence.”

“That’s funny, Piglet. From all accounts, they had nothing to do with my father’s death.”

“They had everything to do with it. They started this war by killing the king.”

“A war? Really? It seems that your side only has one soldier, Piglet.”

“Enough idle talk!” shouted the farmer. “Get on with it! If you’re going to fight, then fight. If not, then walk away. It’s all the same to me. Just bring it to a close. This is a short story, for God’s sake, not a novella!”

The pig and the dog acknowledged the point and started to circle one another.

The pig made a rush at the dog, head down. A miss.

The dog jumped toward Piglet but misjudged his adversary’s speed, landing a foot away from the scurrying pig.

The pig made another pass and head-butted the dog in the rear, but was scratched before darting away.

The dog howled, “You are dead, Piglet.”

“Don’t be absurd, Slurpees. It’s nothing but a scratch.”

“My claws are poisoned, pig.”

“Well, in that case, here goes nothing. NOW, CHARLOTTA!” The pig lowered his head and charged.

Slurpees shouted, “Hey, you stupid pig! You’re running in the wrong direction! Are you blind? Has the poison affected you that quickly?”

But Piglet wasn’t aiming for the dog. He slammed his head against the wobbly wooden gate upon which the farmer and his wife were sitting. Farmer Macbeth fell into the enclosed area, and Piglet immediately started to trample upon his head. Meanwhile, the farmer’s wife screamed that something had bitten her leg. A small black object jumped down into the dirt.

“Did you know the black widow spider is one of the most dangerous animals in Wisconsin?” Piglet shouted. As if to illustrate the point, Gertrude collapsed and started gasping for breath.

Farmer Macbeth yelled, “That’ll DO, Pig! That’ll DO!” He tried to sit up, which was a major mistake. It placed his head at just the right height to connect with the incoming head-butt from Piglet. Macbeth’s neck snapped, and Piglet collapsed on top of his now lifeless form. The pig was completely out of breath. “O, I die, Charlotta,” he wheezed. “The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit. I cannot live to accept the barnyard crown. See that the truth is told. The rest is silence.” The valiant prince expired.

Slurpees trotted up beside them. “Well, it looks like you got your revenge after all, Piglet. Well done. And I got mine. The difference is that I’m still alive!” he gloated.

“But not for long,” said a small voice in his right ear, which was followed by a very sharp pain. Charlotta dropped down and tried to run, but the dog noticed her, and she was brutally dispatched with a quick swipe of his paw. Slurpees collapsed on top of her crushed body.

Within ten minutes, the spider toxin had done its work. All of the primary characters were dead, which pretty much rules out a sequel to this story. Not that you were looking for one.

Porky Pig and several of his brothers crowded around their fallen leader. “Goo-goo-goo-good night, sweet pri-pri-pri-prince. And Fl-fl-fl-flights of angels sing thee to thy re-re-re-re-rest.” Porky waved away the onlookers as they carried the prince’s body to the marshlands.

“Th-th-th-th-that’s all, Folks,” he said.
