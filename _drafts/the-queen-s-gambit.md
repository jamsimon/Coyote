Everyone in the kingdom knew that the real power in Cramalot resided not so much with the king, but with the queen. Well, everyone knew this except for the king, who continued to give orders as if he were actually in control. But no one paid much attention to him.

King Ivory deBlanc the Virtuous had married Princess Blanche the Dubitable when he was seventy years old. His bride was twenty-five at the time and hungry for power. That was ten years ago and Queen Blanche’s lust for dominion had grown even stronger. Concurrently, the king’s appetite for power (and for pretty much everything else) had diminished along with his physical stature. Now at eighty, King Ivory no longer moved very far or very fast, whereas the queen could sweep swiftly through the Kingdom in any direction. She seemed to know everything that transpired in the realm before it even happened, aided by a small network of exceptionally capable spies.

For several years, diplomatic relations with the neighboring kingdom of Merde-la-tête, ruled by King Ebony LeNoir, had been deteriorating. Some whispered that the worsening situation was actually the work of Queen Blanche, but no proof of this was ever found. Moreover, no one could come up with a logical explanation for why the queen would want to nudge the two kingdoms closer to war.

But wanted or not, war was fast approaching.

\************************************************************************************

Having been summoned by messenger, the king’s bishop approached the group of men clustered around the object lying in the field. As he drew closer, the unmoving form took the shape of a man. _No, not a man_, the bishop soon realized. _A boy._ He crossed himself and murmured, “Lord save us all.”

Sir Silverknob, one of the king’s two trustworthy knights, was standing over the body looking grim, his hands behind his back. He looked up at the incoming clergyman.

“Ah, Your Eminence. Thank you for coming so quickly, Bishop Alabaster. I was hoping you could give last rights to this poor boy, but I’m afraid he expired five minutes ago. My men could do nothing for him. He had lost a great deal of blood, as you can see.”

The boy lay on his left side. He almost looked as if he were asleep. “I see much blood, but where is the wound?” the clergyman asked.

“It must be on the other side of the corpse. I was just about to have my men flip the body over.”

“Who was the unfortunate lad?”

“One of the queen’s servants. But I don’t know why he was traveling so close to our country’s border.”

“Yes, well, please finish your work and then I shall say a few prayers.”

The knight gestured to his men and directed, “Turn the page.”

As they rolled the body over, the source of the blood became apparent. There was a large gash in the boy’s left side.

“This wound was caused by a very sharp dagger. It appears he was stuck in passing,” observed the knight.

“He died _en passant_?” exclaimed the bishop. “Who would do such a terrible thing?”

The knight did not respond. He checked the boy’s clothing. Finally, he said, “The page was carrying a message. Here is the pouch. But the seal is broken and it is empty.”

“Was it just a theft, then? Was the boy killed for the contents of his purse?”

The knight frowned and spoke quietly so that his men would not hear. “This was no simple robbery. That poor boy had been someone’s pawn, and his death is likely to be only the first casualty in a bloody war. You had better pray long and well, Your Eminence.”

\*************************************************************************************

News of the page’s demise spread quickly, and the queen convened a War Council for that afternoon. In attendance were the king and queen and their royal court, consisting of two archdukes, two bishops, and two senior knights. In the opinion of Sir Silverknob, the meeting had started badly and was getting progressively worse. Sir Silverknob’s boss, Archduke Ghastly, currently had the floor.

“This incursion must be swiftly redressed,” sputtered the archduke. “We cannot allow King LeNoir to assassinate one of our pages and get away with it scot-free. We must take one of his men in a similar fashion immediately. Show him what’s what, eh?”

The king replied, “Do calm yourself, my dear archduke. Your face is growing red, and we do not wish you to die of apoplexy. Please sit down. Page, fetch our archduke a glass of water. Now, why do we think this killing is the work of the Merde-la-têtes?”

Sir Silverknob wished to respond that it was premature to accuse the neighboring kingdom of this deed, but he remained silent knowing that his opinion would not be welcomed by Archduke Ghastly. Luckily, his counterpart Sir Snowball saved him the trouble.

“In point of fact, Your Highness, we know nothing of the sort right now. The attack happened in Cramalot territory, and there is no evidence that any of King LeNoir’s men crossed the border to do this deed.”

The queen leaned forward and asked, “But is there any evidence that they did NOT do so, Sir Snowball?”

“My lady, no. But it is impossible to prove a negative.”

The queen’s face grew red. _That is never a good sign of a happy outcome_, thought Sir Silverknob.

“It is _not_ impossible,” said the queen. “For example, if you were to prove that one of our own subjects was the culprit, then it would clearly rule out LeNoir’s people. Unless he bribed someone on our side to do it, of course. I wouldn’t put that past him for a moment. In any case, do you _suspect_ anyone in Cramalot, Sir Snowball?”

“We have no suspects at present, my lady.”

“Then it would not be an _unreasonable_ assumption on our part to say that King LeNoir is a likely suspect?”

The queen smiled a tenuous smile, the meaning of which no one in the court failed to understand, least of all Sir Snowball. No one would dare to suggest that the queen was unreasonable. Snowball began to melt, and he quickly backtracked. “No, my queen, you are perfectly correct. King LeNoir must be the prime suspect until proven otherwise.”

“Quite right, quite right,” added Bishop Onyx unnecessarily.

Sir Silverknob forced himself to look away from the smug expression of Bishop Onyx. _What a fawning lapdog that man is_, he thought.

The queen sat back, satisfied.

Sir Snowball wisely sat down, wiped his forehead, and resolved to say nothing more in this meeting if he could avoid it. Sir Silverknob shot him a commiserating glance, inwardly rejoicing that he had remained silent on the matter.

The queen asked, “Was there any physical evidence at all? Was the page carrying anything, for example?”

Sir Silverknob replied, “We found a mail satchel, my lady. But it was empty.”

The queen nodded thoughtfully, then she brought the meeting to a close. “Since we have no _firm_ evidence that LeNoir is behind this, we will _defer_ our decision to wage war against Merde-la-tête. In the meantime, we charge Sir Silverknob with the task of _obtaining_ such evidence. Archduke Ghastly, you shall triple the border guard. _When_ you find any of LeNoir’s spies or soldiers on our land, you are to capture them _alive_ and bring them back to our dungeons for questioning. Is that clear?”

There were sounds of “Aye, my queen” and “Yes, my lady” around the table.

“Well said, O Exalted One,” added Bishop Onyx. Sir Silverknob wisely stifled a groan while the bishop continued, “Now, might I request a personal audience with Your Highness on an unrelated matter of some urgency?”

“Granted, Bishop Onyx. Attend to us in our chambers in ten minutes,” replied the queen. “The meeting is adjourned.”

The king started to say, “We think…” but he stopped abruptly when the queen kicked him underneath the table.

Everyone pretended not to notice.

\**********************************************************************************

Sirs Silverknob and Snowball quaffed their third tankard of ale and ordered one more from the serving wench. The alehouse was packed and it smelled of beer, sweat, and vomit. There was a fistfight taking place in the corner with observers betting on the outcome. Several patrons had passed out on the floor. In other words, it was a normal night at “The Checkered Mate.”

“I don’t understand why you suggested we meet here to discuss this confidential matter,” shouted Sir Snowball into Sir Silverknob’s right ear. “It’s filled with people.”

“Exactly my reason, Snowball,” responded Silverknob loudly. “No one will care to listen to us here, much less be able to hear our conversation if they tried. Trust me, if we had instead met in a deserted alleyway, it would have aroused suspicion; we’d have had ears turned toward us in all directions. This pub is much safer.”

“All right. So what have you discovered?”

“Nothing that the queen wishes to hear. I don’t believe the culprit was from Merde-la-tête. One of the queen’s handmaidens told me she saw the murdered page leaving the queen’s chambers on the afternoon he was killed. I think the queen dispatched him to Merde-la-tête with a message, and he was executed before he could deliver it.”

“Why would Merde-la-tête’s spies kill a messenger who was on his way to them?”

“They wouldn’t. It must have been someone from our own kingdom.”

“Ah. The queen won’t like that. How are you going to break the news to her?”

“I don’t plan to. I think she already knows it.”

\***********************************************************************************

Before dawn the next morning, Sir Silverknob was awakened by a messenger who said that his presence was requested at the border immediately. The knight dressed quickly and ran to mount his horse. He didn’t need to be informed that the situation was urgent. His instincts told him that every second counted now. He could almost hear the clock ticking in his head.

Upon arrival at the newly-established border encampment, the knight proceeded directly to Archduke Ghastly’s tent. There was a heated discussion in progress. The archduke noticed the knight and waved him in.

“We are in the heart of it now, Sir Silverknob. The battle is on. We are at war.”

“How did this happen, Sir?”

“Last night, we killed a Merde-la-tête spy. Their response was swift and terrible. We have lost our bishop!”

“Ah, no. Which one? Not Bishop Alabaster?”

“No, the other one. Bishop Onyx is dead.”

“I see,” said the knight. He was ashamed by the rush of relief that this news brought. “And the spy we killed - he was in our territory, I assume?”

“Well, yes. Practically.”

“Practically? You mean he was actually on Merde-la-Tête land when he died?”

“Well, he was only a few short steps from the borderline. I’m sure the spy would have crossed over the line. Our sentry simply got a little excited and took him out a few seconds before the spy could do so. Everyone has been on edge since the page died. It was understandable in the circumstances, don’t you think?”

Sir Silverknob clenched his fists. “No, Sir, I don’t think that at all. And how was the bishop killed?”

“A blitz attack. He was found dead in his apartment this morning after he failed to show up for vespers.”

“He was back in his apartment? Not on the front line? What makes you believe he was killed by Merde-la-tête?”

“Well, it stands to reason, doesn’t it? We are at war!”

_A war you just started_, the knight thought. _They may not even know of their pawn’s death yet. They certainly wouldn’t have had time to respond by sending an assassin to the city._

“I need you to lead an attack on their left flank, Sir Silverknob.”

“Yes, Sir. I will ready the men.” _But not immediately_, the knight thought. _I need to check something first_. _Maybe the situation can still be salvaged before all hell breaks loose._

The knight saluted and left the tent. Because war was imminent, he began to move stealthily such that any nearby enemy archers would have trouble hitting him. It was the first thing they had taught him in knight school.

_Two steps forward, one sideways. One step forward, two sideways. Two steps forward, one sideways_…

\************************************************************************************

Sir Silverknob slowed his horse as he approached the abbey. He jumped down and rushed inside to find Bishop Alabaster, who granted permission for a search of Bishop Onyx’s apartment. The two of them hurried to the dead bishop’s lodgings.

“What are you looking for?” asked Bishop Alabaster.

“A piece of paper that will hopefully shed light on the mess we are in.”

“You may be out of luck. The late bishop’s rooms were ransacked during last night’s attack.”

They arrived at the apartment to find it as Bishop Alabaster had described. Clothing, books and all manner of objects lay strewn across the floor.

Disheartened, the knight said, “Time is short. There’s no point in searching through this mess. It looks like it was a thorough job. If the paper was here, the assassin already has it. So let’s assume it wasn’t here. If you wished to hide an important document somewhere outside your apartment, where would you go? Don’t think in straight lines. Think diagonally.”

The bishop, who was good at diagonal thinking, considered the problem for a moment. Then he lifted his head. “The cathedral! And I know just the place. A room where no one but Bishop Onyx ventures. Follow me!”

They rushed to the church, and the bishop pulled a key ring from his robe. He unlocked a heavy wooden door at the back of the cathedral, and they hurried down a circular stone stairwell to the crypt.

Forty steps later, it was cold, damp and pitch-black. They slowed down to avoid breaking their necks. The bishop felt his way down by leaning against the clammy wall and carefully moving his feet forward until he felt the next step. The knight followed.

“It might have been a good idea to bring a torch,” suggested the knight.

“I know. I got a little overexcited and rushed forward without thinking. But there is one at the bottom of the steps, along with a flint we can use to set it aflame. Just a few more steps, I believe.”

They reached the bottom and the bishop felt along the wall until he located the torch. After a few false starts, he managed to light it. The knight looked around. The chamber was a cube of about thirty feet on each side. Its floor consisted of alternating black and white squares, each one approximately sixteen square feet in area. There were eight rows and eight columns of these squares. Lining three sides of the hall were twenty-four doors. Each one was painted either black or white, corresponding to the square upon which it was located.

“This is the crypt. By tradition, the king’s bishop (which honor I hold) is only allowed to step upon the white squares and enter the vaults with white doors. Bishop Onxy was the queen’s bishop and he could only step upon the black squares. I suspect the paper you seek lies behind one of those black doors. Under the circumstances, I think we can dispense with the ritual requirements. Let’s grab another torch from the wall and split up. I'll take the first black door on this side while you take the one on the opposite wall. We will work toward the middle until one of us finds something.”

Sir Silverknob opened the first black door on the right. This was a crypt all right. The passage led to a vault lined with stone coffins containing the remains of long-dead royalty and senior clergymen. The knight hoped Bishop Onyx hadn’t hidden the paper inside one of the tombs. He resolved to check all the rooms first before attempting to remove any of the heavy stone lids. No doubt he would need help to do that, in any case.

As he inspected each chamber, he found nothing but coffins and more coffins. One room also contained an urn filled with the ash of a Queen Segreta, who apparently reigned three hundred years ago. But apart from that, the crypts were barren. No furniture or objects which could be used to hide anything. The knight girded himself for the distasteful prospect of opening the sarcophagi one by one.

The knight and the bishop met in the twelfth black vault, having found nothing. Sir Silverknob mentioned the urn.

“An urn?” exclaimed the bishop. “There should be no ashes here. Cremation of royalty has never been permitted. What did you say the queen’s name was?”

“Queen Segreta.”

“I’ve never heard of her,” said the bishop. “But ‘segreta’ means ‘secret’ in Italian.”

They rushed back and pulled the cover off the urn. The bishop dubiously sniffed the contents. “I think this is simply wood ash,” he said.

The knight lifted the urn and dumped the embers onto the floor. Among the ashes lay a letter. He picked it up and, noting that the seal had already been broken, he opened it and silently read the contents.

“As I suspected,” said the knight. “We need to see the king and stop a war.”

“Don’t you mean we need to see the queen?” asked the bishop.

“No. This decision lies with the king, and the king alone.”

\************************************************************************************

Sir Silverknob gained a private audience with the king, who decided to handle the matter at the War Council, which was just about to begin at the request of the queen. They proceeded to the chamber.

Upon entering the hall, Sir Silverknob was immediately set upon by Archduke Ghastly. “Silverknob!” he sputtered. “I gave you a direct order to lead an attack! You have disobeyed me!”

“Not so, Archduke. The men are ready, as you requested. I only await the king or queen’s word to launch an attack. Surely, it is they who must give such an order?”

Overhearing their conversation, Queen Blanche spoke. “Sir Silverknob is quite right, Archduke Ghastly! Was it your intention to usurp our authority?”

“No, of course not my queen, I only…”

“Sit down and remain quiet, little man.”

The archduke took his seat with a scathing glance at the knight.

The queen began. “We have convened this council because we have decided to wage war on Merde-la-tête. The attack on our page and bishop is an affront which cannot go unanswered and…”

“Excuse me, Your Highness, but before you continue may I make a report?”

The queen’s face reddened. “You dare to interrupt us when we are speaking? What is the meaning of this?”

The king said, “You may speak, Sir Silverknob.”

The queen kicked him under the table. To the entire room’s surprise, the king kicked back. Then he stood up. “I command you to give your report, Sir Silverknob.” He turned to the queen and said in an icy tone, “And you shall remain silent, woman.”

For once, the queen didn’t know how to respond.

Sir Silverknob began, “As you know, I was charged to investigate the murder of the queen’s page. I have determined that his death was caused by someone from our own kingdom of Cramalot, not by spies of Merde-la-tête.”

“Nonsense!” shouted the queen.

“BE SILENT OR WE SHALL HAVE YOU CHAINED AND MUZZLED,” shouted the king to universal surprise. In a much quieter voice, he said, “Please continue, Sir Silverknob. And let no one in this chamber interrupt, on pain of imprisonment.” He scanned the room, and no one doubted that the old king had suddenly regained his authority.

The knight continued. “The page was carrying a private message from our queen to King LeNoir of Merde-la-tête. For this, he was killed. I do not yet know who wielded the knife, but I shall find out. I do know who ordered the attack and the theft of the letter. It was Bishop Onyx.”

“Lies!” shouted the queen, who stood up. The king signaled to his guard, who approached the queen. She retook her seat.

“Earlier this morning, Bishop Alabaster and I found the letter hidden in a vault which only Bishop Onyx was previously allowed to enter. I believe that Bishop Onyx had the letter stolen so that he could blackmail the queen with it. I believe that he attempted to do so, and was subsequently killed at the queen’s order.

The king said, “Mmmm. We always thought that Onyx was a bad bishop. But this is a very serious charge against the queen, Sir Silverknob. Where is your evidence?”

“Here is the letter, my king. It is written in the queen’s own hand. It proposes that our kingdom be merged with Merde-la-tête, under the guise of war. It suggests that Your Highness and the Merde-la-tête queen might somehow be killed during the war, following which King LeNoir and Queen Blanche would jointly rule the combined land.”

The king addressed his court. “We have already read this letter, and we confirm that it is written in the queen’s hand. Sir Silverknob, you may pass it around and allow everyone to affirm this for themselves. Guards, arrest Queen Blanche for treason and imprison her in the dungeon, pending trial. Then search her apartments for further evidence.”

The queen was led out of the room, shouting “All of this because my stupid page failed to deliver a letter!? I’m worth nine of him! I should have delivered it myself.”

When she was gone, the king addressed his court. “We are not finished, my dear sirs. Please be seated. Now, Sir Silverknob, have you uncovered any evidence that King LeNoir was complicit in the queen’s plan?”

The knight stood. “No, my lord. Clearly, this particular letter never reached him. But I have no way of knowing whether the queen sent any other missals once she discovered that the first one had been intercepted.”

“Very well,” responded the king. “Here is what we shall do. Archduke Ghastly, please draft a letter from ourselves to King LeNoir, apologizing for the accidental killing of his sentry and informing him of the arrest of our queen for high treason. We shall wait to sign the letter until after our men have searched the queen’s apartment. If no evidence of the king’s complicity is found, we shall immediately send this message and sue for peace. But if it turns out that the neighboring king was involved, we shall have to reconsider whether war must be waged. That is all.”

\*************************************************************************************

Since no evidence of King LeNoir’s participation in (or knowledge of) the queen’s gambit was ever uncovered, war was avoided and a tenuous peace continued to exist between the two nations. Archduke Ghastly retired at King Ivory’s urging, and Sir Silverknob was promoted and assumed his role. The queen was tried, convicted, and put to death.

King Ivory ruled for another twenty years and showed no sign of losing his faculties until the very end. He never remarried.
